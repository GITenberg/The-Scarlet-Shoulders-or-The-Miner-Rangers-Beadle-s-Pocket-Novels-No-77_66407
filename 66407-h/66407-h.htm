<br />THE TRAGEDY.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Indios&mdash;Indios bravos!</i>&rdquo; yelled Manuel Navaja, as he discharged
his <i>escopette</i> full at the glowing disk of old Sol; then
dropping it, he rushed through the outer gates, sounding the
terrible words at every step, his affright being shared by
all the <i>peons</i> who heard him, and, leaving their posts, one and
all swarmed to the main building.</p>
<p>There is a spell&mdash;a fascination like that of a rattlesnake&mdash;that
none but the dweller in &ldquo;the land of the sun&rdquo; can
know. Young and old, men, women and children felt it
now, and all rushed into the <i>hacienda</i>, only intent upon their
own safety. But a clear, stern voice soared above the din,
above the shouts of men, the shrieks of women and children;
and, aided by his strong arm, that dealt blows upon every
hand, he managed to restore order so far that the inner
gates were fastened securely, the window shutters closed,
and doors barred, and then blockaded with such heavy articles
of the furniture as could be moved. The outer gates were
left open; no person would venture there, the <i>haciendado</i>
being held back by a beautiful woman, who twined her arms
around him with strength lent by terror.</p>
<p>Then, with wild yells and whoops, the half nude, paint-bedaubed
horde came swarming through the gateway into
the <i>patio</i>, or outer courtyard, while others assailed the building
in front. The <i>peons</i> within had been hastily armed, and
opened a scattering fusilade, but with little damage to the
enemy, for in their terror they generally fired at random, as
often with both eyes shut as taking aim.</p>
<p>Then the shock came. The doors shook and creaked
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
under the weight hurled against them; the hinges slowly
yielded, but the barricade held them in place.</p>
<p>If the majority of the defenders were cowardly, others
were there whose courage amply supplied this deficiency. A
tall, stalwart man, of a singularly handsome and noble countenance,
went from post to post, reproving or encouraging
the men in a few quick words, pointing out the best methods
of procedure&mdash;at times aiming an <i>escopette</i> with a skill that
spoke well for his marksmanship. This was the <i>haciendado</i>,
Don Christobal Canelo, a man of perhaps thirty years of age.</p>
<p>Close behind him was a lady, who, although her face was
as pale as death, betrayed no fear; on the contrary, whenever
her husband fired a shot, and the wild yell of mortal agony
followed, a smile of pride swept athwart her face, and her
eyes flashed with an ardor equal to his own. Then the
first fury of the assault was checked, the savages drawing
behind the outbuildings, and, turning to note the extent of the
damage inflicted upon his little band, Canelo noticed the presence
of his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, Luzecita, you here! Where is Felipe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Josefa in the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;this is no place for you, my wife. Think, a
bullet might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, Christobal; where should I be if not by my
husband&rsquo;s side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not now; there is danger. You should be with your
child&mdash;our boy,&rdquo; urged Canelo, affectionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is there no danger to you?&rdquo; she added, reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my place&mdash;my duty to encourage and assist the
<i>peons</i>. But think, if you are here, in danger, it will do no
good, and only distract me. I could think of nothing else.
If you should be&mdash;any thing happen to you, what would become
of our Felipe? Come, let me take you to him, where
you will be safe, at least for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave you here to be killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mi alma</i>, if that is to be my fate, your presence could
not avert it, but only make it the more bitter. Your prayers
to the blessed Virgin will strengthen our hands and hearts.
Come,&rdquo; and he led her from the hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;See, <i>comarados</i>,&rdquo; exclaimed Tadeo Campos, the <i>capataz</i>,
&ldquo;the red-skinned devils come again. Show yourselves men
now, and true Mexicans. Fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was answered by a volley that did some execution,
and then the savages hurled themselves against the shattered
door, hewing it with axes, battering it with beams and logs
of wood that they had procured from the <i>caballariza</i> (stable),
while others pummeled the window screens, or fired at the
loop-holes. The <i>patio</i> was filled with smoke, and through it
gleamed the oiled bodies of the Indians, as they flitted to
and fro.</p>
<p>A large hole was now made in the door, and through it
shots were exchanged. But the besieged had the advantage
of being in a darkened room, while the enemy were plainly
revealed. From without the shots were fired at random, although
several took effect; but Campos, with his comrades,
taking deliberate aim, made fearful havoc among their assailants.</p>
<p>But this could not last long. One of the shutters began to
give way before the force applied to it, and the <i>grills</i> of strong
iron bars, called <i>rega</i>, were bending inward, and the ranks of
the besieged were really thinned. Then came a loud shout
from without, and, with wild yells of exultation, the savages
retreated, to the great joy of the <i>peons</i>, for it seemed as if a
few minutes more would see the foe effect an entrance.</p>
<p>For a few moments all was silence within the building; even
the process of reloading was checked, so eager were they to
learn the cause of this strange maneuver. They could hear a
faint hum from without, that told them the enemy had not
yet abandoned the siege. In vain they peered through the
shattered door. The smoke concealed every thing, as it was
a still, foggy day, and it settled heavily upon the earth.</p>
<p>Then came a bright flash, a loud roar, and the <i>adobes</i> by the
side of the door crumbled, while the shock made the entire
house tremble. But one thing could have that effect, and the
swarthy faces turned a shade more ashen as the whisper run
around of:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Los canones!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where had the cannon come from? there were none belonging
to the <i>hacienda</i>. And what were the Indians doing with
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
such a piece? These were questions that all asked, but none
could answer.</p>
<p>If their danger had been great before, now it was increased
tenfold. A few hours, at least, would end the struggle. The
fog and smoke might prevent them from getting range of the
doorway for a spell, but not long; and then one or two balls
would open a breach for their entrance. Another barricade
was formed at the other end of the hall, but that could avail
little. The same power would reduce that, and then it would be
hilt to hilt, breast to breast.</p>
<p>At this new phase, Canelo sought the chamber where his
wife and child were, and hastily explained the cause of the
commotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Luzecita, you must not remain here. We can
not tell what may happen, and with you and darling Felipe in
safety, I can fight with a better will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My place is here. The <i>peons</i> need my influence to encourage
and direct them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you are, I stay&mdash;nay, do not interrupt me,&rdquo; she
hastily exclaimed. &ldquo;I am your wife, and will live or die
with you. The blow that kills you shall reach my heart at the
same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it can not be; think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do think&mdash;I have thought, and I will stay. What would
life be without you?&rdquo; the woman uttered, as she clasped him
around the neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife, you <i>must</i> listen, and you will see that what I say
is best. Think of our Felipe&mdash;what would become of him if
these fiends should overpower us? Remember that not we
alone would perish&mdash;and you know but too well the fate a
woman would receive at their hands&mdash;but he, our bright, beautiful
boy&mdash;he, too, would die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should he live if we are killed?&rdquo; faltered the wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we may beat them off, then no harm is done. But
if the worst is to be, he will have a parent&rsquo;s hand&mdash;a mother&rsquo;s
love to show him how to live. Would you doom him to death,
and he so brave and innocent? And then,&rdquo; as he bent his
head and whispered, &ldquo;think of the one that is to come; would
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;My husband, do not ask me; I can not&mdash;can not leave you!&rdquo;
and she clung to Canelo hysterically, sobbing as though her
heart would break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luzecita,&rdquo; he cried, assuming a stern voice, while the great
tears stood in his eyes, &ldquo;this is folly. You <i>must</i> go, and soon,
or it will be too late. See, if you refuse, I will kill myself
before your eyes! And then you will have my death upon
your soul, as well as that of your children!&rdquo; and he held
her tightly to his breast as he drew a pistol, and, cocking it,
placed the barrel against his temple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christobal&mdash;husband, what would you do?&rdquo; shrieked his
wife, struggling wildly to free her arms, so that she could
avert the weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have said, if you will not flee with Felipe&mdash;our son&mdash;as
I believe in the holy Virgin, I will kill myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough&mdash;enough, I will go&mdash;my God, I will go!&rdquo; faintly
murmured the lady, as she swooned from grief and terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a deeper pain to me, my darling, than death could
bring,&rdquo; he murmured, as he gently placed her upon a sofa, while
the scalding tears fell freely from his eyes. &ldquo;My God, to
speak such words to her&mdash;my heart&rsquo;s darling, when perhaps an
hour may part us forever. It is hard, ah, so hard; but it was
for <i>her</i> sake and our child&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and then he hastened from the
room, after directing the terrified maid to attend to her mistress.</p>
<p>As he entered the hall, the cannon was fired for the second
time, and the six-pound ball crashed through the barricade,
shattering the furniture and scattering the splinters in every
direction. One of the <i>peons</i> was killed outright, and several
others severely wounded. Another shot as well aimed would
clear the passage so that an entrance could be effected. Canelo
knew that he had no time to spare, if he would save his dear
ones.</p>
<p>As he looked for Tadeo Campos, he heard a loud shout and
then the sound of a struggle in an adjoining room, or
pantry, where there was a door leading out into the garden.
Thinking the enemy had effected an entrance, he rushed to the
place, just in time to see the <i>capataz</i> master one of the <i>peons</i>,
and hurl him to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, Campos? Is not that Pepe Raymon?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si, senor</i>,&rdquo; panted the <i>capataz</i>, &ldquo;and a precious scoundrel
he is, too. What do you think? He was unbarring the door
yonder to let in the savages&mdash;the cursed dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure, Tadeo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Carrai!</i> yes. He pretended to be badly wounded, but I
watched him, and when he sneaked off here, I followed after,
and was just in time, as you see. The upper bolt is drawn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he must be put beyond chance of doing us any further
harm. Take this pistol, and when it is unloaded, come to me.
I have work for you to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had scarcely passed the door, when the report told that
the traitor had met his doom, and then Campos overtook his
master. In a few, quick words, Canelo told him what he required
him to do, and although the <i>capataz</i> looked any thing
but pleased at the task, he dared not hint as much.</p>
<p>He was to conduct his mistress and child, with the servant,
by a rear exit, from the <i>hacienda</i>, trusting that the besiegers
would be all occupied with the cannon and preparing for the assault,
in front of the building, and the dense and smoke-laden fog,
to effect their escape unseen. It would be risky to attempt securing
horses, as the stable was probably occupied by the savages,
so they were to hasten on foot to the <i>chapparal</i>, where they
could lay concealed until the fate of the building was settled.
It was risky, but would not entail as great danger as remaining
in the building, when in a few minutes more, at the furthest, a
hand-to-hand combat must take place.</p>
<p>Tadeo Campos first reconnoitered the ground, found the
way clear, and then, after a few hasty words of parting, the
husband, wife, and child separated, never more to meet on this
earth alive.</p>
<p>And not a minute too soon, either. Another ball hurtled
through the barricade and completed the breach. The <i>haciendado</i>
returned to his men, and formed them into a double rank to
meet the onset that he knew was coming. Over the heads of
the kneeling ones, those in the rear leveled their <i>escopettes</i>, nerved
with despair, to meet their fate like men. Many of them were
the veriest cowards that lived, but now, under their master&rsquo;s
eye, and knowing that, while there was no chance of fleeing,
no quarter was to be expected from their red-skinned foes, they
would fight desperately and well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Then came the rush. There was only a subdued rustling,
as of many feet cautiously planted, and then from the dense
fog a horde of the painted demons rushed into the breach left
by the shattered door. Their own impetuosity came near being
fatal to themselves, for, as the crowd became jammed in the
doorway, and entangled in the mass of broken furniture, the
clear, strong tones of Canelo rung out the order to fire.</p>
<p>The double volley, delivered at such close quarters, was
withering in its effects. The savages fell in piles, almost
blocking up the entrance, and the others shrunk back from
such a deadly reception. The besieged, led by Canelo, sprung
forward to meet them, with <i>machetes</i>, pistols, or clubbed guns.
Then came an order for the savages to rush over their dead
and close hand to hand.</p>
<p>Christobal Canelo started, as if thunderstruck. The order
had been given in <i>pure Castilian</i>, and, moreover, he could
almost have sworn that he recognized the voice as that of
one whom he had befriended, trusted, and loved!</p>
<p>And then where did an Indian&mdash;a Comanche upon the
war-path&mdash;learn to speak that language so perfectly? And
to his braves; could they comprehend him? If so, they
must be strange savages.</p>
<p>But he had no further time to ponder over the matter.
The savages had rallied, and tearing their dead comrades from
the breach, they swarmed into the house, led by a tall, sinewy
man, who dashed into the midst of his foes. In vain Canelo
strove to meet this person, for he knew that if their chief was
slain, the assailants would probably retreat. But the savage
ever eluded him, ever kept a crowd between him and the
<i>haciendado</i>. He wielded a heavy saber that, while it seemed to
shed the blows rained at him, like a magic shield, dealt death
or gaping wounds at every stroke.</p>
<p>Several savages had singled out Canelo, and were pressing
him hard. Two of their number had fallen before his
sword, but he was wounded, and the blood flowed freely. It
required all his address and activity to keep from being
clenched from behind by his enemies; but then, as he clove
down the foremost, he dashed to the wall, where he could no
longer be surrounded.</p>
<p>The savages were all around with <i>sabers or machetes</i>, and he
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
was fast failing. Still he met them bravely. A saber laid
bare his cheek but the man who dealt the wound went down
the next moment with his head cloven in twain.</p>
<p>The tall leader of the savages saw this, and, hissing out a
fierce oath, drew his pistol, and, retreating to the wall at a
space that was free from combatants, deliberately aimed at
the brave Canelo. The latter saw nothing of this, as he desperately
struggled with his assailants. Then the finger pressed
upon the trigger, and there came a flash, a loud report, and the
<i>haciendado</i> sunk at the feet of his foes, with the blood slowly
oozing from the little discolored hole in the center of his
forehead, a dead man.</p>
<p>His death was noted by a <i>peon</i>, and he raised the cry. It
was like depriving a ship in a storm of its rudder, the fall of
their leader, and with but one or two exceptions, the besieged
threw down their weapons and begged for quarter. But the
mercy they received was like that rendered famous in the
revolutionary war, as &ldquo;<i>Tarleton quarter</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One by one they were cut down, even as they kneeled and
implored mercy in the Virgin&rsquo;s name, and in two minutes
after the death of Christobal Canelo the only survivors were
they who wore the paint and trappings of Comanche warriors;
even those who were dying received a finishing stroke.</p>
<p>The leader did not await this. As soon as he had murdered
the <i>haciendado</i>, he left the hall, and proceeded at once,
and without hesitation, to the room where Canelo had so
shortly before changed his wife&rsquo;s resolve of sharing his fate.
He looked through this apartment as though he was seeking
some person, and then ran hurriedly into the other rooms,
but with the same result. What he sought was not there.</p>
<p>Calling to his men in a tone choked with rage and baffled
vengeance, he cried to one, a huge, herculean man:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mil diablos</i>, Barajo, the birds have both vanished! But
they can&rsquo;t be gone far, for they were here an hour since.
Take you a few men and circle around the place. Scatter,
and look well, for if they are lost, what we have done here is
all for nothing. Find them and a thousand <i>pesos</i> are yours.
<i>Al monte&mdash;al monte! Capa de Dios!</i> why do you wait?&rdquo;
raged the disguised Mexican or Spaniard, for surely an Indian
tongue never mastered the <i>lingua Espagnol</i> so perfectly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>But at length the men returned from a fruitless search, and
then, half wild with rage and disappointment, the leader reluctantly
gave the order for marching, and they filed out from
the <i>hacienda</i>. The building was left intact, with the exception
of what injury had been done by the cannon. The outhouses
were undisturbed; the stock, both horses and cloven-footed
animals, were abandoned. Truly they were a strange
war-party of Comanches in more ways than one.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />A STORY TOLD AND A SURPRISE.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Madre mia</i>, why so sad this bright and beautiful day, when
all should be as gay and happy as it is out of doors?&rdquo; exclaimed
a young girl, as she entered the room, and, kneeling at her
mother&rsquo;s feet, lifted the bowed head, holding it between her
two dainty palms, and pressed affectionate kisses upon the
pale cheeks and lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, child, if you knew what anniversary this sad day is,
you would not wonder at my grief,&rdquo; returned the elder lady,
mournfully. &ldquo;Luisa, child, how old are you?&rdquo; she added,
half vacantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mother, need you ask that?&rdquo; laughed her daughter.
&ldquo;I am nearly nineteen! Almost an old woman, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
and her soft, gleesome laugh again rung out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Luisa; you have never learned the true way in
which your father&mdash;my husband, died. But you are old
enough now, and I think I can bear to tell it all. I have
been thinking of the past this morning&mdash;of your father and
brother, child, who was stolen when you were a babe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Stolen!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Luisa, eagerly. &ldquo;I thought you said
he was dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so he is&mdash;he <i>must</i> be, or I should have found him
years ago,&rdquo; murmured the mother; and then she detailed at
length the incidents embodied in our first chapter, so far as
she was conversant with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We lay concealed in the <i>chapparal</i>, where the undergrowth
was most dense, Felipe and I, together with Tadeo Campos
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
and Josefa. How we managed to reach the place, I know
not. My mind was distracted with fear for my husband and
my son. And then, as we crouched there, under a thorny
<i>mezquiti</i>, we heard the loud shouts and tramping of men, as
they searched for us, and we could hear them speaking <i>in
Spanish</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how my poor heart bounded with joy then, as I thought
that my husband had been victorious, and would have cried
aloud to them, if brave, prudent Tadeo had not placed his
hand upon my mouth, and bade me beware; that he feared
they were foes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said that he had suspected the men who had attacked
the <i>hacienda</i> were not Indians, although disguised as such, but
were Mexicans. Why, he did not say, but bade me remain
quiet for my child&rsquo;s sake, while he would reconnoiter, and
learn for certain who the voices belonged to that we had
heard. Then he crawled along and was gone but a few moments
before he returned. One glance at his face told me the
worst, and I swooned away in my great grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was but too true. The <i>hacienda</i> had been taken, and
my husband killed, not by Indians, but by our own countrymen,
although who they were or who led them we never
learned. Toward midnight we cautiously returned to the
house, and there I found your father, dead! shot through the
brain!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a horrible sight. The mangled bodies of our brave
<i>peons</i> lay in heaps upon the floor, where they had been slain.
Not one of them had been spared, or escaped that dreadful
massacre, save us four. All were dead!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house, as you see, was left standing, the herds were
untouched; nothing, save a few articles of plate and the
ready money, was taken. Surely a war-party of Indians
would never act in this manner, and it further confirmed a
belief that the marauders were of our own country. But what
was their object? Alas, I fear it was but to murder all,
although for what reason I know not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mounted our horses and fled from the spot, after
burying your father, and did not rest until we reached the city
of Guanajuato, where we arrived nearly dead from fatigue and
hunger, and told our tale to the kind friends we met there. I
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
dispatched Tadeo Campos, with a note detailing the sad tragedy,
to your uncle Augustin Canelo, who was then at the city of
Mexico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was fearfully enraged and grieved at his brother&rsquo;s murder,
and vowed to search the world over but he would have
revenge. But we could give him no clue to the assassins.
Well, he sent a number of his own <i>peons</i> to the <i>hacienda</i>, and
when it was renovated we returned to it. He remained with
us at my request, and for a year all went well. He would be
absent for weeks at a time on business connected with his
silver mines, or searching for some trace of the murderers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought my cup of sorrow was full, even to overflowing,
but I had yet to endure more; another fearful blow awaited
me. You, my child, were nearly six months old, when one day
our little Felipe, the darling boy, so brave and beautiful, and the
image of his father, was torn from me. He had been stolen,
but by whom or how, could never be discovered. The Indians
were very troublesome then, and I thought that perhaps they
had stolen, perhaps murdered my son for the sake of the rich
clothes and costly jewels that he wore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For long months we searched far and wide for some traces
of him, but in vain. The river and <i>arroyos</i> were dragged, the
<i>chapparal</i> searched inch by inch, but there were no traces found.
In my grief I thought I should die, but it was denied me. And
now do you wonder at my sorrow? On this day, nineteen
years ago, my husband was murdered; one year later, on the
same day, your brother Felipe disappeared&mdash;perhaps met the
same fate!&rdquo; and she bowed her head upon her hands, while the
hot, scalding tears trickled through her fingers.</p>
<p>The girl at her feet sat in silence, her dark eyes dimmed at
the tragical tale she had just listened to. Her sorrow was
less than that of her mother, for her brother she could not remember,
and the father her eyes had never rested upon, seemed
but in a remote degree associated with herself. It was a subject
that her mother had ever avoided, and Luisa was too gay
and light-hearted to press the topic; so it is not to be wondered
at that she did not feel the intense grief that agitated the form
of her mother.</p>
<p>No one who could have seen her then would have pronounced
her other than beautiful. She was rather under the
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
medium size, but so perfectly proportioned that she appeared
taller. Her large, lustrous black eyes were shaded by lashes of
the deepest jet, and her finely-arched eyebrows were of the same
sable hue. Glossy black tresses were braided like a coronet
around her finely-formed head, whence a mass of fine ringlets
flowed over a neck and shoulders which would have been considered
fair even in our land of blonde beauties, and in her
sunny clime were deemed white as the newly-fallen snow. A
stranger&rsquo;s eye would detect and dwell upon the faintly dark
shading on her upper lip, that in a youth might have been
termed an incipient mustache. But is it a blemish? Her
friends thought otherwise. It but added another attraction to
her piquant beauty.</p>
<p>Her mother was slightly taller, but the same contour of face
and great resemblance, although somewhat impaired by time
and sorrow, showed that Senora Luzecita Canelo lived again in
her daughter Luisa.</p>
<p>They were aroused by a light tap at the half-opened door,
and glanced around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well Josefa, what is it?&rdquo; said Luisa.</p>
<p>The old nurse entered the room on tiptoe, as if fearful of
disturbing the mistress, and whispered, in a low tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a stranger, <i>&rsquo;na</i> Luisa, on particular business, he says,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where is Sarguela; he attends to all such, as you
know, Josefa,&rdquo; interrupted the maiden, a little impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Garcia is with him, but he says he must see the senora;
that his business is for her ear alone,&rdquo; hesitated Josefa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wishes to see <i>me</i>,&rdquo; asked the lady, looking up. &ldquo;What
and who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he will not tell; but he is a handsome <i>cavallero</i>, and&mdash;pardon
me, lady, if I say that he is a perfect image of <i>el coronel</i>
when I first saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of my husband?&rdquo; exclaimed the lady, as her face flushed.
&ldquo;And young, say you? Oh, Santissima Virgin, if it should be&mdash;ah,
no, he is dead long since,&rdquo; she murmured; then added:
&ldquo;Go, Josefa, and show him here. I will see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few moments the old nurse, as she was still called, returned
and ushered in the persistent stranger. At first he
appeared somewhat abashed and ill at ease, for the ladies had
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
arisen and were facing the door in half eager expectation, and
quickly doffing his hat he made a stiff, slightly awkward bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart, the picture!&rdquo; faltered Senora Canelo, pointing to
a full-length portrait of her husband, hanging against the wall.</p>
<p>Luisa instantly checked the smile that lurked around her
rosy mouth, called forth by the <i>outre</i> demeanor of the stranger,
and she too uttered an exclamation as she glanced from the
face to the picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I crave your pardon, ladies, if I appear rude, but I have
seen so little of society, that for a moment I was dazzled,&rdquo; he
apologized, in a soft, musical tone. &ldquo;Am I right in thinking
I address Senora Canelo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my name, senor; and yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, lady, <i>once</i> I would not have hesitated in replying
<i>Felipe Barana</i>; but now, if this packet does not give me a
name, I know not that I have one,&rdquo; replied the youth, in a
mournful tone, as he advanced and placed a small parcel, securely
tied and sealed, in the trembling hand of the senora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Felipe&mdash;he said Felipe, and then that face,&rdquo; murmured
she, as she sunk heavily into the chair she had just quitted, and
with trembling fingers began to untie the package.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be seated, senor,&rdquo; said Luisa, motioning to a chair, and
placing one for herself, so as to partially screen her mother,
whom she saw was strangely perturbed.</p>
<p>Senora Canelo tore the wrapper apart, and laying upon an
inner package was a note superscribed with her name, in a
bold, firm hand that seemed familiar. It was unsealed, and
opening its folds, she hurriedly glanced at the contents. Then,
with a wild cry, she started to her feet, and advanced a step
toward the stranger, but her limbs refused to do their duty,
and she sunk to the floor in a swoon.</p>
<p>Luisa bent over her, shrieking for help, and as she loosened
the throat of her mother&rsquo;s dress she caught the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Felipe&mdash;my son&mdash;thank God!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josefa came rushing in, and unceremoniously hustled the
stranger out of the room, and set about restoring her mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear, <i>&rsquo;na</i> Luisa, it is only a fainting fit; there&rsquo;s no
cause of alarm. In a few moments it will be over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure, Josefa, are you sure?&rdquo; eagerly queried the
sobbing girl. &ldquo;<i>Ay de mi!</i> She looks like dead!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; it&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;nothing at all. Why, bless you,
child, she&rsquo;s had thousands of them!&rdquo; returned the old nurse,
exaggerating a little, the better to reassure Luisa. &ldquo;See, the
color comes to her lips, and, praise the Virgin, her eyes open!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, mother, I thought you were dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;where is he&mdash;Felipe, my son?&rdquo; and the lady half
raised from the lounge, glancing eagerly around the room, then
sinking back, she wailed, &ldquo;<i>Nuestra Madre de los Merced!</i> it
was all a dream, a cruel, bitter dream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, it was no dream; he is here&mdash;the stranger, I
mean, who looks so much like papa&rsquo;s portrait. And see, here
is the letter he gave you!&rdquo; exclaimed Luisa, placing the note
in her mother&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call&mdash;but no, I must have been mistaken; <i>he</i> is dead long,
long since! My daughter, read what <i>it</i> says, to me; my eyes
are blurred, and I can not see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luisa opened the note with intense curiosity, but then
looked up in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mother, it is from Uncle Augustin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, go on&mdash;read, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">My deeply-wronged sister</span>:&rdquo; it began, &ldquo;when you read this,
I shall be no more. I am dying, and the <i>padre</i> tells me that, before
the sun goes down, I shall be dead. How this occurred, the bearer
of this, my dying confession, will tell you. I have deeply wronged
you and yours, and stained my soul with a horrible crime; but now
make reparation as far as lies in my power. Listen, and, in God&rsquo;s
mercy, do not curse me after I am dead! <i>I</i> hired the men who, disguised
as Comanches, attacked the <i>hacienda</i> nineteen years ago, and
by my hand, <i>my brother</i>&mdash;your husband&mdash;died! I was mad, crazy,
but I loved you, and thought that, if he was out of the way, in
time you would listen to my suit. Then I caused your son, Felipe,
to be stolen, and at the time meant to kill him, for I was poor, and
he stood between me and wealth. But my heart failed me, and he
yet lives, a noble, brave boy, who looks at me with <i>your</i> eyes and
his father&rsquo;s face. I can not tell you all I would of my reasons for the
crimes I confess, for my strength is fast failing. But I will send this
by <span class="smaller">YOUR SON</span>, although he knows not who his parents are. I inclose
the jewels and a scarf that he wore when he was first abducted, so
that you may have no doubt. And now listen to my prayer, the last
I shall ever make. I know I have been fearfully guilty, yet I do not
think I could rest in my grave if you should curse me as the murderer
of your husband. I do not ask for forgiveness, but that you
will strive to forget me; as though I had never been born. May
the holy Virgin ever smile upon and guard you, and cause the son
I return to your heart to be a joy and a blessing. As I hope for
mercy hereafter, he is your only son, Felipe.</p>
<p><span class="lr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Augustin Canelo.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>The mother did not speak while this strange letter was being
read, but pressed both hands tightly upon her bosom, as if
to still the painful throbbings of her heart, while the breath
came in gasps from between her pallid lips. When the last
word was pronounced, she essayed in vain to arise; then, as
she sunk back, feebly whispered to Luisa, who was scarcely
less agitated than herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, Luisa; go bring <span class="smaller">YOUR BROTHER</span> to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sister needed no further prompting, but sped away like
a startled fawn to the room where her brother had been so
unceremoniously consigned by Josefa. He was pacing rapidly
to and fro, his handsome countenance expressing no small degree
of wonder and perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Felipe, my brother, don&rsquo;t you know your little sister,
Luisa?&rdquo; she cried, and throwing her arms around his broad
shoulders, stood on tip-toe to press her lips to his.</p>
<p>He was startled, as well he might be, but the tempting lips,
pouting out like twin cherries, would have enticed far older
and more sedate hearts than his, and clasping her to his breast,
he pressed kiss after kiss upon her blushing face, with an ardor
that half alarmed her. Truly, it would be pleasant, really
pleasant, to be a big brother, if all sisters were like Luisa.
But the voice of the mother was heard from within, calling
him to hasten, and Luisa said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Felipe, brother; come to mother,&rdquo; and together
they entered the room.</p>
<p>Old Josefa stole out from the apartment, and we will follow
her example, for the meeting between the long-parted ones
was sacred. But an hour afterward the three were seated
close together, while before them lay the jewels and scarf that
the mother instantly recognized, and they removed any doubt
that she could have entertained as to the reality of the youth&rsquo;s
identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you recollect nothing whatever of this place, Felipe?&rdquo;
asked his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can not just now. Perhaps it will come back to me
when I am a little less bewildered. Remember what a surprise
I have had; I, who thought I was alone in the world,
without even a <i>name</i>,&rdquo; he replied, as he kissed first one and
then the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;No; the first I can remember is being in a little village
on a mountain&rsquo;s side, and then it changes to a vast and gloomy
cavern, with wild-looking men all around me. I know now
that they were Jarochos and a sort of <i>guerilleros</i>, who robbed;
but I never knew of their shedding blood, unless in a quarrel
between themselves. And as I grew older I became one of
them. Do not start, or look so terrified, for you must remember
that I knew no better. It was the way I had been taught
and I thought all men were like us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man whom I called father&mdash;your uncle, Luisa, who
went by the name of Don Serapio Barana&mdash;was the chief or
leader of the band, and he taught me this, and gave me the
education I have; him and <i>padre</i> Gayferos. He would often
be gone for weeks and months at a time, and then the lieutenant,
Lopez Romulo, would be left in command. He was a
wicked, cruel man, and I hated him!&rdquo; Felipe added, while his
eyes flashed and a hand crept to the jeweled hilt of the poniard
that peeped from his bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twice he insulted me so bitterly that, if it had not have
been for those around me, I would have slain him like a dog,
as he is. Well, one day, perhaps two weeks since, when I returned
from a hunt of several days&rsquo; duration, I found Don
Barana at the point of death. How it happened I only could
learn that he had been wounded in an attack upon a <i>conducta
de plata</i>&rdquo; (convoy of silver), &ldquo;in which the band had been repulsed
with severe loss. Then he told me that he was not my
father, but that he would send me with a package, and the
one who received it would tell me all concerning who and
what I was. He made me promise to deliver the packet into
no hands but your own, as I valued my future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then <i>padre</i> Gayferos dismissed us all from the room or
chamber in the cave, as he wished to receive his last confession.
In a few minutes they told me he was dead, and then
I took a last farewell of my rough but kind friends. I amused
myself on the long journey with picturing what would be my
reception&mdash;who I would turn out to be; but ah, <i>mi almas</i>, the
most romantic air castle did not realize the truth!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
as he caressed his newly-found relatives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my children,&rdquo; murmured the mother, &ldquo;this has ever
been a fearful, horrible anniversary for me, hitherto, but now
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
it will be divided with joy. On it I lost a dear husband and
a son; but the one is an angel in heaven, where he is now
smiling down upon us, and the other is here! Oh, my son,
my Felipe, we must never more part in this world. For
eighteen years I have mourned for you, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, for thrice that long we will rejoice together!&rdquo;
exclaimed Luisa joyously, as she nestled closer against her
brother&rsquo;s arm, looking lovingly up into his handsome face.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />MARCOS SAYOSA, THE YOUNG MINER.</h2>
<p>The <i>venta</i> of <i>tia</i> Joaquina was widely celebrated among
the miners of Los Rayas for the excellence of its liquors, the
fine flavor of its <i>cigarettes</i>, and the buxom beauty of <i>el patrona</i>,
or &ldquo;the hostess.&rdquo; Situated on the outskirts of Guanajuato,
it was allowed a little more license then would have been
shown it, had it stood in a more respectable portion of the
city. Many a night of wild revelry, drinking, carousing,
quarreling, and fighting had been passed there by the hotheaded
young miners of the surrounding country, without fear
of being interrupted by the entrance of the <i>alguazils</i>, to wind up
their festivities by a morning visit at the <i>levee</i> of the <i>alcalde</i>.</p>
<p>Many a tragic scene had those old walls witnessed, either
within or without, as the miners of Los Rayas, as a general
thing, are not over punctilious in regard to the shedding of blood
when their veracity or honor is deemed brought in question.</p>
<p>A young man was slowly approaching the <i>venta</i>, and although
he kept his hand upon the haft of his <i>cuchillo</i>, it was
more from habit than caution, for he was evidently in a deep
reverie. But when he reached the door of the <i>posada</i>, he threw
off this feeling, and entering the room, was met by the <i>patrona</i>,
a large, handsome woman of perhaps forty years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>&rsquo;nor</i> Marcos, you are here at last,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
warmly greeting the miner, who was an especial favorite with
her. &ldquo;The <i>cavalleros</i> have given you up, and, as you can
hear, are enjoying themselves hugely,&rdquo; she added, as a burst
of laughter came from beyond a thickly-listed door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>tia</i> Joaquina, I was delayed, and even now, if I must
confess the truth, I own more than half inclined to give
the lads a cold shoulder to-night. I am not in the humor
for revelry,&rdquo; said he, in a low voice, that sounded rich and deep
as the tones of a flute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>P&rsquo;r Dios</i>, that would never do! There is business to be
done to-night. I believe they have heard that on the morrow
the <i>Melladios</i> are going to try the strength of your &lsquo;Scarlet
Shoulders,&rsquo; and see if the defeat you gave them at the last&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Virgin of Atocha! but that is good news,&rdquo; exclaimed
Marcos, his full, black eyes sparkling with ardor.
&ldquo;We will teach the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>H&rsquo;la, &rsquo;na</i> Joaquina!&rdquo; shouted a voice, as the door was
opened and a head thrust through the aperture from within.
&ldquo;Bring some more&mdash;<i>mira, comarados</i>, the capitan is making
love to Santa Joaquina!&rdquo; he yelled, as he caught sight of the
young miner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treason&mdash;treason!&rdquo; they shouted, as several rushed forth,
and, clustering around Marcos, forced him laughingly into
the room, where he was greeted with cheers and <i>vivas</i>, that
testified to his popularity.</p>
<p>It was a long, low-ceiled room, the rude <i>adobe</i> walls white-washed,
but the rough rafters overhead were black with
smoke and festooned with cobwebs, the accumulations of
years. A rough table ran the entire length of the room,
with a narrow passage at either end. Along the sides and
secured to the walls were small stands, intended for three
persons each, and all equally guiltless of cloth or covering
of any kind. Lights were suspended from overhead, and,
with candles stuck in niches around the walls, illumined the
room sufficiently for the purpose.</p>
<p>A thick, hazy cloud of smoke now filled every crevice, being
supplied by the glowing <i>cigarette</i> that each man held,
some forty in number. Before them were scattered various
utensils that were, or had been, full of liquor. Tin and bone
cups, stone jugs and leather bottles, in every possible position
that such utensils could possibly assume, covered the table.
The <i>patrona</i> was far too careful of her crockery to intrust
it in such hands, even though sure of being paid for the
damage done. It was too scarce a commodity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>He who was called Marcos Sayosa finally seated himself
at one of the side tables, with two of his more particular
friends, who quickly enlightened him as to the truth of the
subject hinted at by Joaquina. To understand it more fully,
the reader must know that the men who worked in Los Rayas,
and those of Mellado, a neighboring mine, were bitter
rivals, each party contending that their mine was the richest
and best, and many were the contests, both single and
<i>en masse</i>, that had taken place; all leaving the point in question
as far from being settled as ever. It had reached such
a point that regular organizations were formed on both sides,
with officers chosen, signals and passwords arranged, and the
office of <i>spy</i> was well rewarded. Of the miners from Rayas,
who had gained the <i>soubriquet</i>, &ldquo;Scarlet Shoulders,&rdquo; from the
knot of ribbon of that color they wore around their left
shoulder, Marcos Sayosa was the chief, while a middle-aged
man, Perico Fuenter by name, commanded the opposition.
The two war-cries, &ldquo;Rayas&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mellado,&rdquo; were as famous
and promptly answered as that of the &rsquo;prentices in London
of &ldquo;clubs.&rdquo; When they were heard, those not belonging
to the faction barred their doors, and sought such place of
security as they could find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Lucas Planillas, the second in command,
&ldquo;they swear they will go through the town on the morrow,
and make every man drink to the health of their cursed hole,
and vow that it is far superior to our blessed mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish them joy of the attempt,&rdquo; sneered Marcos, &ldquo;but
this&mdash;this spy; who is he? I never heard of him before as
I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylva Cohecho is his name. But who he is I know not,
save that he gave the signals and grips all correct. Look,
yonder he is, at the next table. Shall I call him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; I wish to take a good look at the gentleman first.
So, that is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man that he looked upon was one that would have
attracted attention in any company, not for his beauty, either
of face or person; on the contrary, he was rather under-sized,
but had the head and shoulders of a giant. As he
faced the captain, with one arm dangling by the side of his
seat, the immense length of arm and deepness of his chest
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
was fully revealed. His cheeks and chin was covered with a
stiff, bristly mass of grizzled hair of much more recent growth
than his mustache, the ends of which rested upon his shoulders.
He was dressed in the usual holiday garb of the <i>mineros</i>,
and from beneath the slouched brim of his straw hat one
piercing black eye glanced around the room. The bridge of
his nose was wanting, the purple scar showing that it had
been mutilated by the same blow that had deprived him of
his eye. Altogether he was not exactly the person a traveler
would be pleased to meet upon a solitary road. And so
thought Marcos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Voto a Brios, &rsquo;nor</i> Lucas, but he is a hang-dog looking fellow.
Are you sure he is not a spy upon the wrong side?&rdquo;
muttered Sayosa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know as much about him as I do,&rdquo; returned Planillas.
&ldquo;But if you suspect, better end it before harm is done. Say
but the word, a nod, and he will never trouble any one, unless
it is his master, the devil,&rdquo; significantly tapping the hilt of
his knife that peeped from his shirt frill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Planillas; at least not until I have had speech with him.
The <i>mezcal</i> he is using so freely may loosen his tongue after
awhile. But have you sent messengers to the rest of the
band?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By daylight the city will be full, and all prepared for
business,&rdquo; said the lieutenant, as he lighted another cigar.</p>
<p>They sat conversing in whispers for some time, forming their
plans for the expected assault, and drinking but sparingly.
Then the young captain heard a name mentioned that made
him start from his chair and listen intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>H&rsquo;la, &rsquo;nor</i> Carlos,&rdquo; shouted a young man across the table,
&ldquo;you know how you were foiled by that little Carlita, the
one who lives with old <i>tio</i> Tomas? Here is a <i>cavallero</i> who
has been smiled upon by the Virgin, ay, and the black-eyed
<i>doncella</i>, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it you mean. Not yourself, I hope,&rdquo; replied the
man addressed, a little sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so happy. But I referred to Senor Don Despierto
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true, <i>senores cavalleros</i>,&rdquo; added Despierto, with mock
modesty. &ldquo;I saw the beautiful Carlita, and as I had nothing
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
of greater importance on my hands, I laid siege to her affections,
and&mdash;succeeded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Venus, the cunning little prude, and she would not so
much as even look at me!&rdquo; murmured Don Carlos. &ldquo;But
how far did you succeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far can&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold, Senor Despierto!&rdquo; shouted Marcos, as he leaped
forward and grasped the speaker by the shoulder. &ldquo;<i>Por todos
de Santos!</i> if you do not retract that base calumny, and
say that you foully lied of one who is as pure as the holy
Virgin herself, I will tear your tongue out by the roots, and
force it down your throat!&rdquo; he hissed, compressing his fingers
until it seemed they would meet through the yielding flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mil demonios</i>, if you were twice my captain, you should
answer for this,&rdquo; gritted Estevan Despierto. &ldquo;Unloose your
hand, or I&rsquo;ll unloosen it with a dose of steel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah, if you looked on a knife you&rsquo;d turn pale and run
like a <i>coyote</i>!&rdquo; said Marcos, as he hurled the other from his
seat, half way through the crowd that had gathered around
the disputants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Marcos; he&rsquo;s drawn his <i>cuchillo</i>,&rdquo; cautioned
Planillas, as he leaped before his captain, who was prepared
for the attack of his foe. &ldquo;<i>Abojo&mdash;abojo los armas</i> (down with
your weapons). Do you think there are no bodies to carve
but those of your friends? Remember the <i>Melladios</i>!&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace, <i>&rsquo;nor</i> Planillas. He must either retract his words,
and acknowledge he was lying, or not all the saints will save
him from my vengeance,&rdquo; calmly, but bitterly said Sayosa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Despierto is not a Sayosa. He never denies his word,&rdquo;
sneered Don Estevan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough. Stand aside, <i>comarados</i>, and let us end this,&rdquo;
gritted Marcos, drawing his <i>cuchillo</i> and wrapping a <i>frazada</i>
(a woolen cloak) around his left arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>H&rsquo;la, senores</i>,&rdquo; called a voice from the crowd. &ldquo;Fair
play! let them fight upon the great table, so we can all see
the sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ready for any thing that was novel, the <i>mineros</i> soon
cleared the table, by brushing the drinking utensils upon the
floor&mdash;thus proving the <i>patrona&rsquo;s</i> prudence in abjuring
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
crockery. A few minutes sufficed for this, and then the combatants
leaped upon the table, prepared for the <i>sport</i>, while
the spectators crowded around the arena, or stood upon the
little stands by the side of the walls, eagerly staking their
money upon the first wound and result of the duel.</p>
<p>Marcos had doffed his hat and outer <i>jayneta</i>, revealing a
closely-fitting garment of quilted silk. A sash was tightly
bound around his waist, and a handkerchief secured his long
hair from falling over his face. His antagonist was prepared
much like the same. They were both handsome, well-built
and hardened men, but there was a peculiar look about Despierto,
that could only result from dissipation and excesses,
that was not visible in his adversary, and the older gamesters
freely laid their money against him. They knew that in
a prolonged contest he must go down before his more temperate
foe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Andela!</i>&rdquo; (forward), shouted Lucas Planillas.</p>
<p>At the word both men bounded forward, and their knives
met with a clash that sent showers of tiny sparks to the table.
Then their thrusts and blows were made so quickly, the parries
and changes of position were so rapid, that the eye could
not follow them. It was like the rapid shifting of the kaleidoscope
when quickly turned. The eye could catch the motion,
but ere it could fix the details, another combination
would obliterate its predecessor.</p>
<p>Despierto was slowly being forced back, or retreated from
policy, when, as Marcos stood near the edge of the table,
Sylva Cohecho&mdash;he who had brought the news of the intended
attack by the <i>Melladios</i>&mdash;thrust forth a hand, and strove
to catch the young miner by the foot. If he had succeeded
it must have been fatal, for Estevan would have profited by
the stumble, and ended the combat then and there. But
Lucas&rsquo; eye caught the motion in time to frustrate it, and as he
delivered a swift blow behind the spy&rsquo;s ear with his clenched
fist, an adroit trip of the foot sent him headlong under the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cursed crookback, you would do murder?&rdquo; yelled Planillas,
drawing his knife and diving under the table just as
Cohecho crowded out through the crowd, who were ignorant
of the cause of the disturbance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>He ran to the door, and turning, saw Lucas dart forward.
Drawing a pistol from his belt, he fired at the youth, the bullet
piercing his <i>sombrero</i>, while a faint yell and heavy fall among
the spectators told that the bullet had not been entirely harmless.
Cohecho saw Planillas stagger, and thinking his aim had
been true, burst open the door with a strong pull, and rushed
through the bar-room, gaining the open street in safety, sending
back a wild, taunting laugh of triumph.</p>
<p>Further pursuit would be worse than useless, so the miners
returned to the room where the fight was still in progress, and
a little knot gathered around the dead body of a youth, who
had been shot through the brain by the missile intended for
Planillas. The latter only gave one glance at the victim, and
then turned to view the duel.</p>
<p>They were both wounded, but evidently not very severely.
The perspiration ran in streams from their bronzed faces.
Marcos adroitly unrolled the <i>frazada</i> that enveloped his left arm
until it nearly reached the floor. And, as the motions of his
knife were thus concealed, penetrated his antagonist&rsquo;s guard,
and sent his long blade to the hilt in Despierto&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>But an attempted parry of the latter diverted the aim
slightly, and instead of passing between his ribs, as was intended,
the knife glanced into his back, inflicting a painful
flesh wound, but not disabling the duelist. The force of the
blow, however, staggered him, and he fell upon his back, as
his foot slipped upon some blood. Marcos kicked the knife
from his grasp, and then kneeling upon his breast, pressed the
point of his knife against the man&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, base liar, unsay the words, or by the Virgin of
Atocha, I will kill you like a dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Don Estevan Despierto!&rdquo; scornfully replied the defeated
duelist, as though in those words were contained his answer
to the threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once more I ask you. If you do not, before I count ten,
you will never speak again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! your arm is not strong enough, nor your heart brave
enough to kill a man,&rdquo; sneered Despierto, vindictively struggling
to free himself.</p>
<p>For a moment all was breathless silence in the room. Naught
was heard but the half-choked breathing of the man, who, laying
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
upon his back, with a foeman&rsquo;s knees pressing into his
breast&mdash;the dull, red gleam of the long knife that had already
drank his blood, as it was poised above his throat, glancing
full in his eyes, quailed not, but glowered fiercely at his conqueror,
as if daring the final blow. Then a faint murmur ran
around the room, half of admiration, half of pity for the bold,
strong-hearted man who was about to meet his death. But no
one offered to interfere; had he done so, a score of knives
would have confronted him. By the miner&rsquo;s laws of the entire
country, Despierto&rsquo;s life was forfeited to his victor, to be
taken when and how his fancy might dictate. Still, a shudder
ran over the spectators as the voice of the young miner began
to count; it had a hard, metallic ring to it, that appeared to
fill the entire room, like the clanging of a huge bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, seis, siete, ocho</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he counted no further, for the door was thrown violently
open, and Joaquina rushed in from the bar-room, screaming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Valga me Dios, cavalleros</i>, you are betrayed! The accursed
<i>Melladios</i> are here. <i>Hay mucho&mdash;muchissimos!</i>&rdquo; (they are many.)</p>
<p>Instantly all was confusion. Several of those nearest the
door ran out to the entrance to see if it was not a false
alarm, while the rest hastily possessed themselves of their firearms
that were stacked in the corner of the room. Marcos
Sayosa arose from the prostrate body of his foe, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will settle this affair afterward. Now, every man is
needed. Will you help your comrades?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I belong to the band,&rdquo; haughtily replied Despierto, &ldquo;and
will do my duty. You will not have to search for me, if we
are both alive after we chastise these beggarly hounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! I will trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud roar, as of many voices, was heard from without,
closely followed by a volley of firearms, and then two of the
&ldquo;Scarlet Shoulders&rdquo; re-entered, bearing between them the
wounded body of their comrade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />THE MINER&rsquo;S RIOT.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Anda, comarados</i>,&rdquo; shouted Sayosa, &ldquo;push the table against
the door, quick; the <i>ladrones</i> are here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was performed, but none too soon, for, as the massive
table was thrust against the closed door, a rush was heard in
the outer room, and the assailants gave it a fearful shock; but
thanks to its brace, the heavy puncheon did not give way, although
it shook upon its hinges. A volley was fired at the
door, but it was only a waste of ammunition, as the four
inches of well-seasoned wood resisted all such attempts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out with the lights, men, and then open the loops. Perhaps
we may return the compliments of our friends outside,&rdquo;
added Marcos.</p>
<p>The shouts of the besiegers in the tap room, together with
the clashing of the bar fixtures, told but too plainly the fate of
the <i>patrona&rsquo;s</i> wines and liquors. Nothing else could be expected,
for the <i>mineros</i> were not accustomed to having such a
windfall every day, and even those who usually were so chary
of the exhilarating beverage when good, hard money had to be
disgorged in lieu, now emptied glass after glass.</p>
<p>Joaquina cowered in one corner of the room, ringing her
hands in despair, as she pictured her loss, praying to the Virgin
that the liquor might choke the <i>ladrones</i>, or pouring out a torrent
of vituperation that only an enraged <i>Mexicana</i> could invent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Madre de Dios</i>, good <i>patrona</i>, rest your tongue for a while,&rdquo;
exclaimed Marcos, half impatiently, &ldquo;or the <i>padre</i> will require
a fortune before he can absolve you at next confession. Look,
if you are injured by this night&rsquo;s work, we will make it up to
you either in money or a <i>venta</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Muy bueno</i>, then I hope the villains will drink the barrels
dry, for then they would be beyond doing you any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, that is a good thought! Is there enough for that,
<i>&rsquo;na</i> Joaquina?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capitan, there is a large body of men out here in full view.
Shall we fire?&rdquo; interrupted a man who was standing at a loop-hole.</p>
<p>He was speedily answered, for scarcely had the words issued
from his lips, than a blaze of light shone in at the loop-holes,
and the loud roar of many guns told that the half-drunken
<i>Melladios</i> had fired a volley at the building. The man
who had just spoken gave a convulsive spring into the air, and
fell dead at his young leader&rsquo;s feet, shot through the throat.
A low, thrilling rattle, a gasp, and he was dead!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire, men, fire!&rdquo; yelled Sayosa, as he sprung to the loop-hole
thus vacated, and sent his bullet with the rest.</p>
<p>The stars shone brightly enough to indistinctly reveal the
forms of their assailants as they surged to and fro in the open
space beyond, and at the dense mass were the guns discharged
with deadly effect. The reports were followed by a hideous
uproar: the groans and shrieks of the wounded, mingled with
the hoarse yells of rage and vengeance of their comrades; the
rushing tramp hither and yon, as they retreated or advanced,
according to their courage or recklessness; the clang of steel,
shot and <i>escopettes</i> against the pavement as the weapons were
reloaded; the flash and dull roar as a piece was discharged at
the building&mdash;all made up a wild, weird picture.</p>
<p>Afar off could faintly be heard the roll of a drum and call
of bugles, showing that the town was alarmed, but that afforded
neither fear to the one nor hope to the other party, for
well they knew that the military force available could do nothing
toward quelling the riots, and, before aid could be procured,
the matter would be decided in one way or the other.</p>
<p>Marcos Sayosa had no fear of the ultimate result being
against him. He knew that his comrades of the Rayas mine
would soon learn of their situation, and, until they should arrive
to the rescue, he could hold the building against the <i>Melladios</i>.
So, by his orders, the men kept up a steady fusillade
from the loop-holes wherever a foe could be seen, and by
dodging as quickly as their shot was delivered, the return fire,
aimed at the flashes, was harmless, although several bullets
passed through the apertures.</p>
<p>Then came a wild, ferocious yell from the besiegers, as if at
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
the arrival of some powerful auxiliary. The occupants of the
<i>posada</i> were not long left in doubt as to the meaning of this
uproar. Indeed, the truth was suspected before the cries had
died away, and those nearest to the door soon heard the roaring,
crackling sound that but one thing emits&mdash;<i>fire</i>.</p>
<p>It was but too true. The <i>Melladios</i> had splintered the shelves,
outer door, and bar-room furniture, piled it in the center of
the room and against the partition door, poured spirits over
it, and then applied a candle. Although the side-walls were
of sun-dried bricks, or <i>adobes</i>, there was plenty of fuel in the
floors, partition, roof and ceiling, that would burn like tinder,
and was a danger not to be scorned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! the drunken fools; let them yell. We will foil
them yet,&rdquo; sneered Sayosa. &ldquo;Here, half a dozen of you cut a
hole through the <i>adobes</i> at the further end. You can do it
easily with your <i>machetes</i> and <i>cuchillos</i>. The rest of you keep
up a fire on the demons out yonder. The light will reveal
them plainly now, and it will keep them from suspecting what
we are doing. This bonfire will show our <i>conpairanos</i> where
to seek us, and then we will take a dear revenge upon these
rascally dogs who disgrace the name of <i>mineros</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While uttering these directions, the young leader was not
idle, but led the party in their work upon the end wall of the
building. Under the sharp points of their weapons, wielded
by strong and willing hands, the hard clay began to crumble
and fall to the floor. But it was thick, and required time.
The fire had already began to creep along the roof of the
apartment, and the massive door showed signs of rapid burning
upon its inner side. The room was oppressively hot and
close; perspiration dampened the clothes of the besieged, and
in their eagerness to obtain a breath of fresh air, through the
loop-holes, they exposed themselves to the bullets of the beleaguers,
and two were instantly killed, while several others
received flesh-wounds in the head, more or less dangerous.</p>
<p>Then a blow, better directed than the rest, pierced the wall,
the wielder&rsquo;s hand and arm following the knife. They could
not suppress a shout of joy, and worked on with increased
energy to enlarge the aperture. Foot by foot it fell outward,
and then, when it was large enough for their purpose, Marcos
ordered his followers to reload all their firearms, as it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
likely they would be needed. Then, selecting two of the
most trustworthy miners, he directed them to hasten at full
speed through the town, and raise assistance by sounding the
motto of the Scarlet Shoulders.</p>
<p>Then the little band pressed through the aperture, and the
messengers darted off into the darkness upon their errand.
Before the last of the Scarlet Shoulders were outside of the
burning building, a loud shout told both them and the main
body of their foes that they were discovered. A wild rush
was made toward them, and telling the terrified <i>patrona</i> to flee
for her life, Marcos retreated rapidly from the circle of light
cast by the burning <i>venta</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Melladios</i> came rushing on, outnumbering their rivals
three to one, and evidently thinking that the Scarlet Shoulders
would not dare risk a hand-to-hand combat. Indeed, several
of the miners shouted out that the cowards were running, in a
derisive voice. But if this was their thoughts, they were soon
undeceived. As soon as the gloom was entered, and while
the enemy were in the broad light, Marcos Sayosa directed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Comarados</i>, when I give the word, fire, and then drop on
your faces. The man that stands up will never do so again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little band stood firm with leveled carbines, and the
foe approached. Half crazed with drink, they thought not of
caution, but with demoniac hoots and yells, they crossed the
point Sayosa had selected as the limit. Like a clarion note
the young miner&rsquo;s voice sounded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Fire, men, fire!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a sheet of lightning the carbines vomited their contents
almost in the face of the enemy, at less than twenty paces.
The front ranks went down like the weeds before a prairie fire,
as many, perhaps from surprise and terror as wounds. Those
in the rear discharged a random volley, but as the Scarlet
Shoulders had obeyed their leader&rsquo;s orders and dropped to the
ground, it was perfectly harmless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, <i>compadres</i>, out with your steel, and teach the cowardly
dogs better manners than to molest men!&rdquo; yelled Marcos,
as he drew his <i>machete</i> and sprung into the <i>melee</i>.</p>
<p>Before the <i>Melladios</i> recovered from the confusion the unexpected
onslaught had thrown them into, their foes were upon
them, slashing and thrusting, fighting with sword in one hand,
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
a knife in the other with which to deal wounds or ward off
blows, as might be. Thus a fearful scene ensued.</p>
<p>The dense mass of swarthy, powerful men, swaying to and
fro, wielding the deadly weapons they had been familiar with
from childhood; yelling, cursing, cheering and blaspheming
like a horde of demons fresh let loose from pandemonium;
the long black hair floating around their fierce, inflamed faces
with every movement; the weapons flashing around them,
clashing together until tiny showers of sparks gritted from the
steel, falling swiftly, to rise again, gleaming a dull red, while
the ruby drops of life-blood trickled from the edge or point;
the shrieks and moans of the wounded wretches as they are
trampled ruthlessly under foot; the falling forms of those who
are stricken unto death in their tracks, or tottering away from
the <i>melee</i> to fall in some unoccupied spot, where they can die
undisturbed, save by the terrible din; while the burning house
roars in concert, casting its ruddy light over the conflict, revealing
every phase in all its details, and the crash of the
heavy walls, seem in keeping with the fall of man.</p>
<p>Oh, what pen could portray such a scene? The dreadful
interest of the whole would absorb the particulars.</p>
<p>Foremost among the <i>Melladios</i> was the form of the man who
had betrayed the Scarlet Shoulders&mdash;he who had enacted
the part of spy to lull their suspicions&mdash;Sylva Cohecho.
Sayosa recognized him, and divining the true part he had
played, strove to encounter him to reward his treachery. But
whether by accident or design, in this he was baffled, for sometime,
as was also Lucas Planillas.</p>
<p>The traitor seemed to bear a charmed life, and as his long,
powerful arms wielded a heavy sword, he cut down or beat
off all who attacked him, until at length Marcos found himself
face to face with the spy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accursed dog, I have met you at last, and now you
will never play the spy again!&rdquo; hissed the young miner, as
he aimed a heavy, downright blow at his foe, but which slid
harmlessly from the <i>machete</i> of Cohecho.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! you crow loud for a chicken that has not yet grown
his spurs,&rdquo; taunted the ruffian, as he returned the compliment.
&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Estevan Despierto will not have you for a rival with <i>&rsquo;na</i>
Carlita, after to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall live to see the <i>coyotes</i> poisoned by <i>your</i> carcass, at
any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tumult was constantly increasing in the city, and was
rapidly nearing the scene of the conflict; but the combatants
did not heed that. The long-smothered rage and rivalry between
the partisans had now broken bounds, and it must be
a strong barrier that would be able to stay its course.
Although blood had been spilled upon more than one occasion
by the factions, it was only in solitary instances, settled
rather as a duel between enemies than a partisan affair. But
now the revolt had come to a head, and nothing but the
complete defeat of one party could check the riots, unless, indeed,
a military force should arrive sufficiently strong to <i>compel</i>
peace&mdash;an event that was far from likely.</p>
<p>At this point of the contest, a crowd of armed men arrived
upon the scene, and, with loud shouts of &ldquo;Los Rayas forever!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Down with the <i>Melladios</i>!&rdquo; they plunged into the <i>melee</i>, and
the next minute the enemy broke, and fled in every direction,
darting into the gloom that was rendered more intense by the
contrast with the ruddy glow of the still burning building,
closely pursued by the victorious miners.</p>
<p>The rescuing party of Scarlet Shoulders who had arrived
so opportunely, had been closely followed by the police and
military force; but these prudently awaited until the battlefield
was comparatively clear, when they boldly advanced and
arrested several of the victors and a few wounded. But the
cry for rescue was quickly set up, and the miners promptly
rallied, with wild yells, and charged the troops. These latter
worthies, deeming valor the better part of discretion, abandoned
their captives and fled for their lives, seeing the folly
of attempting a resistance.</p>
<p>The rioters well knew what penalty awaited them if they
should become known, and collecting their wounded, speedily
vanished to place them in security. But the affair was not yet
over, as they well knew. The defeated <i>Melladios</i> would collect
reinforcements, and another effort would be made to retrieve
their lost honor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />THE RESCUE.</h2>
<p>The rioting and confusion did not entirely cease, although,
owing to the retreat of the <i>Melladios</i>, it was but in an idle and
desultory way, either among themselves or the police of the
town. These last worthies, after one or two <i>rencontres</i>, left the
city to the tender mercies of the victors, and sought safety in
flight. But as many of the Rayas miners had families or
friends living in the place, the principal source of danger was
to be dreaded from the <i>Melladios</i> attempting to storm the
city.</p>
<p>So the night wore on; fresh recruits coming in from time
to time to join the Scarlet Shoulders under Marcos Sayosa,
until he had a body of hardy, resolute men strong enough
to make him have little doubt as to his being able to hold his
own against whatever force might be brought against him.
So, instead of fortifying any of the buildings, he contented
himself with posting sentinels around the town, with attendants
to carry the news in case any enemy should appear.</p>
<p>The few hours that intervened before daylight he spent in
searching for Despierto, but without success. Whether he
was dead, a prisoner, or had fled, he could only conjecture,
but for the time his vengeance must be deferred.</p>
<p>About the middle of the forenoon a strong body of the
<i>Melladios</i> appeared in view at some distance from the city, and
Marcos Sayosa, at the head of the majority of his men, sallied
out to give them battle. As they came within gunshot, a
volley was exchanged, but without material effect, and the
<i>Melladios</i> retreated before the impetuous charge of the Scarlet
Shoulders, who pressed forward at speed with wild hurrahs
of victory.</p>
<p>But then Sayosa hurriedly ordered them to halt, turning
his face anxiously toward the town. They could hear the
rapid reports of firearms and faint shouting, while the thin,
sulphurous smoke could be seen rising above the housetops.</p>
<p>Then they comprehended the trap they had fallen into:
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
that the <i>Melladios</i> had signally outwitted them. They knew then
the reason why the enemy had so suddenly and strangely retreated
without joining, hand to hand. It was their object to
draw the main force, if not all of the Scarlet Shoulders, from the
advantageous position they held, under cover of the houses,
and keep them employed while another body took possession
of the city.</p>
<p>The plot was well laid, and a few more minutes would have
insured its success, if, indeed, it had not been already accomplished.
Sayosa knew that his only hope was to gain the city
before his comrades were overpowered, or, placed between
two fires, he would stand a fair chance of being cut to pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back, <i>comarados</i>, back to the city! Never mind those
<i>ladrones</i>; <i>anda&mdash;anda</i>!&rdquo; he shouted, and darted forward at
the top of his speed, closely followed by his men, all fully
sensible that nothing but celerity of action and desperate fighting
could repair the folly they had been led into.</p>
<p>Then the tables were turned. The pursued became the
pursuers&mdash;the chasers chased. Each man strained every nerve,
and ran as he had never ran before. The one to reach the
city in time to assist their beleaguered comrades, the other to
overtake and force the Scarlet Shoulders into a struggle that
would detain them until the other division of the <i>Melladios</i>
should have accomplished their mission.</p>
<p>Two men were seen to run from the town, but when they
saw the miners returning, sped back to announce the news
to those who had dispatched them for assistance.</p>
<p>The pursuers and pursued were scattered over the plains&mdash;the
swiftest of the former close upon the heels of the rearmost
of the latter. Fortunately all firearms had been discharged,
or a serious loss would have been inflicted. As it
was, more than one of the Scarlet Shoulders were cut down
before the city was reached.</p>
<p>As the fugitives swept down an angle in the street, Marcos
Sayosa halted, and ordered his men to face the foe. This was
promptly done, and the bright swords and scarcely less terrible
knives flashed in the sunlight. Others hastily began
reloading their <i>escopettes</i>.</p>
<p>The enemy came sweeping on, uttering their wild yells and
shouts of exultation. The rearmost of the men from whose
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
left shoulders streamed the bright knot of ribbon, came up and
fell promptly into the ranks.</p>
<p>Then the <i>Melladios</i> swept around the corner, and so great was
their impetus that many ran headlong into the close ranks of
their foes, and then the cold steel began its work. Almost
without resistance a score of the leaders were cut down, and
then, while the remainder faltered at the sudden and unexpected
resistance, the loud, clear tones of Sayosa rung out the
order to charge!</p>
<p>And right bravely was his call responded to. Sounding
their war-cry: &ldquo;Rayas forever&mdash;down with the <i>Melladios</i>!&rdquo; the
Scarlet Shoulders rushed into the confused mass of men, and
for a few brief minutes the blood flowed like water.</p>
<p>The enemy quickly rallied and fought desperately, but the
momentary surprise had been fatal to their chance of successful
resistance. Outnumbered and without order, they sustained
the fearful onset for a time, and then, pressed back, slowly
giving way, foot by foot, at first, and then more rapidly, until
at length they turned on their heels and fled in despair, closely
pursued by the victorious Scarlet Shoulders. But Marcos
Sayosa sounded the recall, that was obeyed, and just in time.</p>
<p>Their comrades who had been left in the town now appeared
in view, being driven back by their assailants. Sullenly
and with desperate courage they fought the overpowering
force of <i>Melladios</i>, stubbornly contending the ground inch by
inch, borne back, not by superior bravery, but by mere force of
numbers. But one man turned to flee in affright, and he was
promptly cut down by one of his comrades.</p>
<p>Then sounding their war-cry, the victorious division of the
Scarlet Shoulders pressed forward to the rescue, and the tug of
war commenced. The <i>Melladios</i>, flushed with success, would
not retreat, although now outnumbered, and the street was
filled with the clash of steel and the horrible din of a death
struggle. But the scale was turned by the miners of Rayas,
the band who had reloaded their firearms, and at close quarters
poured in a withering volley, some of the victims being
scorched by the burning powder.</p>
<p>This started the retreat, and then began a bloody running
fight from one end of the city to the other. Three several times
did the fugitives rally and strive nobly to retrieve their lost
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
fortunes, but in vain. They were overmatched, and finally
broke in every direction, each man fleeing as choice impelled
him, only intent upon escaping the avengers who stood in
their footpaths.</p>
<p>The pursuit was continued by the main body for several
miles, and when they abandoned it a few still persisted.
Marcos Sayosa led his triumphant band back to the town, and
retiring to the house he had selected as his quarters for the
present, with his officers, they deliberated as to what should
be their future course. They well knew that should their
identity become known, and they were captured by the military,
there could be but one ending. And some hours they
argued <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, without coming to any definite conclusion.
They knew that in a short time the fugitive military
would return with reinforcements, against which they would
stand but a faint chance of making a successful resistance, even
were they mad enough to attempt it.</p>
<p>The city was gloomy enough. The main street was still
scattered with the dead and wounded miners, lying as they
fell. The houses were all closed and barred, the inhabitants
most likely trembling lest their doors should be forced and
their wealth, perhaps even life, be taken. Several <i>posadas</i> had
been forced open, and the Scarlet Shoulders were fast becoming
uproarious over the confiscated wines and liquors.</p>
<p>The young captain was standing with Lucas Planillas and
several others upon the <i>azotea</i>, still in consultation, when
Sayosa suddenly paused, and, shading his eyes with his hand,
peered keenly toward the south-west. The form of a single
horseman was riding at a break-neck speed toward the city,
while on the rising ground far beyond him could faintly be distinguished
the light cloud either produced by a fire or the discharging
of guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Voto a Dios, &rsquo;nor</i> Lucas, but I believe there is mischief going
on yonder. Surely a fight is going on; perhaps some
of our <i>comarados</i> are in trouble. Go you and see what the
<i>cavallero</i> is spurring so fast for, and let us know as soon as possible;&rdquo;
and then, as Planillas departed upon his errand, Marcos
turned to his companions, and added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cavalleros</i>, we may be needed yonder. See how many
horses you can find before the lieutenant returns, and one of
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
you pass the word for the men to be in readiness to march,
if needs be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he turned toward the point where the horseman had
been seen, he found that Planillas had just met him, and, after
a few moments, during which, apparently, a few explanations
were given, the man dismounted, and Don Lucas, vaulting into
the saddle, galloped on toward the headquarters. Descending
the steps, Sayosa awaited his approach, and, when within call,
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>amigo</i>, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are needed out yonder. There is an escort guarding
some ladies that have been attacked by a band of <i>Melladios</i>,
who outnumber them two to one. They have sent to ask assistance.
Will you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cascaras</i>, yes! Go you and start what men you can find on
foot. We will follow as soon as horses can be got. In a few
moments,&rdquo; hastily returned Marcos.</p>
<p>In two minutes the majority of the Scarlet Shoulders were
<i>en route</i> on the double-quick toward the scene of the struggle,
and three more saw about a score of horsemen, including the
leaders, spur out from the city, well mounted upon confiscated
horses that quickly carried them past the footmen, who were
ordered to push on at top speed for the rescue.</p>
<p>The reason for the miners being all upon foot is not fully
known, when perhaps there was not a man in the band but what
owned one or more horses. But partly from policy, and partly
from being ignorant of the period of the intended attack by
the <i>Melladios</i>, such was the case.</p>
<p>In ten minutes the horsemen had reached the scene of the
surprise, and were none too soon, for the <i>peons</i> were fast falling
before the more numerous army of the assailants, and, although
fighting desperately, were being forced back. At their
head fought a tall, handsome cavalier, bare-headed and blood-stained,
but whose saber drank blood at every stroke, while the
rearing and plunging of his snorting horse helped to keep him
free from the mass of miners that swarmed around him.</p>
<p>With a loud cheer of encouragement, the little band of
horsemen plunged into the <i>melee</i>, and joined the leader, who
welcomed them with a cry of pleasure. Still they were greatly
outnumbered, and, although encouraged by the accession, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
<i>peons</i> fought with renewed energy, it was all they could do to
hold their own against the raging mass. Time and time again
did the horsemen charge among the enemy, beating them back
with the desperate onset, yet each time the miners closed around
them, and they had to cut their way out again, gradually losing
some of their number, either by death or by being unhorsed.</p>
<p>The work was all done with the cold steel. There was no
time to reload their firearms, and perhaps it was well that such
was the case. The <i>peons</i> were ranged around a sort of coach, or
close carriage, in which were the ladies, and obstinately retained
their position, although so closely pressed that it seemed a
miracle they were not annihilated. The bodies of their
horses, and the ones which had drawn the carriage, were lying
where they had been shot at the first onset.</p>
<p>Then with wild yells the foremost of the Scarlet Shoulders
came up and poured a withering volley of musket balls into
the close ranks of the <i>Melladios</i>. In the excitement their approach
had not been noticed, or was unheeded. In a moment
the struggle was changed, and with yells of dismay, the miners
broke in confusion and fled from the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Andela, comarados, andela!</i>&rdquo; shouted Marcos Sayosa.
&ldquo;Give the cursed <i>ladrones</i> no quarter; give them a lesson they
will not forget soon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scarlet Shoulders pressed hotly after the fleeing <i>Melladios</i>,
fulfilling to the letter the order given them. Marcos
Sayosa alone remained behind. The cavalier already mentioned
was at the side of the carriage, and opening the door, eagerly
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&mdash;Luisa, are you safe and unhurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Felipe; but you? My God, you are killed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is only a scratch&mdash;nothing; a little cut from a
<i>machete</i>, that is all. Thank the Virgin you are safe! I thought
it was all over with us, when this <i>cavallero</i> came up,&rdquo; and he
turned to where the young miner sat upon his horse, wrapping
his scarf around a severe gash in his left arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, senor, if I neglected you for a moment. But
this is my mother and sister, and they might have been injured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were perfectly right, <i>&rsquo;nor cavallero</i>, and no apologies
are needed. But if you will be so kind as to knot this troublesome
scarf, I will remain your debtor,&rdquo; returned Marcos.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, brother; it was for us that he received it, let <i>me</i> fasten
it,&rdquo; interrupted a musical voice from the carriage, and as the
speaker looked forth, Sayosa gave a start of mingled admiration
and wonder that called up a deeper blush to the cheek of
Luisa Canelo, that made her still more charming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand pardons, <i>senorita</i>, but I am a rough, unpolished
miner, and the sight of such loveliness confused me. I really
thought that an angel&mdash;there, see, I have sinned again!&rdquo;
he added, with a slight laugh of confusion, as he saw the effect
of his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a sin then that my sister has often provoked,&rdquo; said
Felipe, feeling slightly annoyed. &ldquo;But pardon, again. This
is my mother and sister. I am Felipe Canelo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am called Marcos Sayosa,&rdquo; added the young partisan,
as the other paused, &ldquo;a poor miner at your service,&rdquo; bowing
first to the man and then the ladies, who politely acknowledged
the salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see, your arm still bleeds. Allow me to bind it up,&rdquo;
said Luisa, and as the miner rode up to the carriage, her fairy
fingers deftly fastened the bandage, while her face flushed hotly
beneath the admiring but respectful gaze of Sayosa.</p>
<p>On the opposite side Felipe was undergoing the same process
at the hands of his mother. The latter seemed puzzled at
some thought, and glanced curiously at the young miner, who
never looked handsomer than at that moment, although his attire
was somewhat stained and disordered by the adventures
he had so recently passed through. The tumults within his
breast had not yet died away, but the fierce ardor of battle
that glowed in every feature and flashed in his eye, was tempered
by the sight of the beautiful maiden who was so tenderly
ministering to his wound.</p>
<p>He had never before met with so much beauty and grace
centered in one woman, and there was a strange sensation
about his heart that should have warned him such company
would be far more dangerous to his peace of mind than the
weapons that had so lately been playing around him were to
his body. But not then did he think of this. He would have
been either more or less than man, had he done so.</p>
<p>As Luisa put the last touch upon the bandage, Canelo came
around the coach, and addressed the miner:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Senor Don Sayosa, can you tell me if I can procure horses
in the city? Ours are all dead or fled but my own bay, and
we must get to shelter soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The city, senor, is no place for ladies now, but I think I
can help you. Last night the miners from Mellado attacked
us of Los Rayas, and the city officers have all fled the town. I
command the men you saw, and they will be like wild beasts
from blood and drink,&rdquo; he added, as Felipe was about to interrupt
him. &ldquo;But if you desire it, I will select a band on whom
I can depend, and guard you until you are beyond all danger.
As we disband to-day, I fear I could do but little with the
mass to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, we will accept the offer as freely as &rsquo;tis made,
for you do not paint a very pleasant or reassuring picture.
But the horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will send an order to my men who remained at the city,
if you can dispatch a couple of <i>peons</i> with it. They will send
horses, although I fear your followers will have to travel on
foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can, until we reach some place where I can purchase
mounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the course of half an hour the two <i>peons</i> returned from
the city, each astride of a stout, serviceable horse, and by stripping
the dead ones of their harness, the carriage was soon in
readiness for the road. Some little time was consumed in
waiting for the return of the desired Scarlet Shoulders, but at
length two score were selected upon whom Sayosa knew he
could depend. After a consultation with Lucas Planillas, his
lieutenant, the young miner deputed the command to him,
both to disband and arrange the necessary signals by which
they could be recalled, if necessary; the coach started and
rolled rapidly along the sandy road, surrounded by the escort.</p>
<p>Owing to the sand cast by the wheels the windows were
closed, and although Felipe and Marcos rode close to the sides,
all conversation was checked except between themselves; although
more than once the young miner caught the great black
eyes of Luisa glancing toward him, and then it would be difficult
indeed to tell which one was the most confused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />CARLITA.</h2>
<p>The sun set and twilight ensued, but for a brief space. The
moon was near its full, and arose nearly as soon as its more
brilliant brother had disappeared, and in that clear atmosphere
its light rendered objects with nearly the distinctness of noon-day.</p>
<p>In perhaps an hour after sunset the party halted for supper,
there fortunately being enough stowed behind the coach in a
hamper for a tolerable meal. Then for the first time Marcos
Sayosa heard the cause of the journey and residence of the
party he had been so fortunate in rescuing.</p>
<p>They had been on a visit to some friends at the city of
Mexico for a couple of weeks, and had got thus far upon their
return home, intending to pause for the night at Guanajuato,
when they were attacked by the <i>Melladios</i>, who had ambushed
themselves in a shallow ditch, being part of the band repulsed
by Marcos on the edge of the town, as already detailed.</p>
<p>Marcos seemed wonderfully attracted by Dona Luisa, while
she, in return, appeared to feel the same influence, although
much less plainly shown. Still, it did not escape the notice
of her mother and Felipe. The latter especially seemed ill at
ease, and hovered close to his sister, acting more like a lover
than the relation he held toward her. But he heard nothing
at which he could take offense; every word spoken by Marcos
was respectful, almost reverential; but his tones evinced his
sincerity, telling that if not in love, he was not very far from
that most delightful state.</p>
<p>After an hour&rsquo;s rest the company again started, intending
to travel the greater part of the night. The wind had died
away, and as the night was warm and pleasant, the carriage
windows were let down, and a desultory conversation was
kept up by the four persons. During it Sayosa received
a cordial invitation to pay the Canelos&rsquo; <i>hacienda</i> a visit, so
warmly pressed that when Luisa added her soft voice, he accepted
it, though not without some inward misgivings as to
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
the wiseness of throwing himself in the way of temptation,
when presented in such a bewitching form as Luisa Canelo.
He knew too well that it would be presumptuous in him to think
of her for his bride, and would not that be the result?</p>
<p>Toward morning they again halted, and at daybreak Sayosa
and his followers took their leave, as now there could be
no further danger, and that day would see them safe at the
<i>hacienda</i>. The men were not allowed to depart without a
liberal reward from Felipe, and probably not one regretted
the duty that had been forced upon them.</p>
<p>The party separated, Marcos riding off by himself on a
course that would carry him considerably to the left of Guanajuato.
He rode slowly along, little heeding what course he
took, with his mind in utter confusion. The sentences that
he muttered from time to time told the subjects of his
thoughts. They were of Luisa Canelo and <i>love</i>. He pshawed
and pished at the idea of being in love with her, but this
very fact showed that there was some foundation for the surmise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! what a fool I am getting to be,&rdquo; he exclaimed, impatiently,
&ldquo;thinking of her in this way! As if she would
look at me in my station, except as one who had done her a
slight service! I half expected they would offer me gold,
to pay me for my trouble. But, they did not; perhaps they
understood me too well. And then&mdash;am I not pledged?
Yes, and to one who can compare favorably with even the
proud Senorita Canelo&mdash;my Carlita! I love her; surely I
do, and yet&mdash;bah, I am a fool, and worse!&rdquo; he muttered, as
tightening the reins, he applied his spurs, and galloped swiftly
over the prairie.</p>
<p>With but a short pause at noon to allow his horse necessary
rest, he rode rapidly until late in the afternoon, passing
Guanajuato, and finally reached a small stream that ran
through a group of trees. Dismounting, he led the animal
along a narrow path, with the relieved air of a man who
was at his journey&rsquo;s end. Suddenly he paused.</p>
<p>A shrill, piercing shriek rung out upon the still air, closely
followed by another; then came the hoarse tones of a man.</p>
<p>Relinquishing the bridle and drawing a pistol, Marcos
sprung forward toward the point from whence the alarm
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
sounded. He knew full well the owner of the first voice,
and a cold, chilling hand seemed grasping his heart, as he
thought of her danger&mdash;she to whom he had given his first
love and pledged his hand&mdash;Carlita.</p>
<p>Running through the undergrowth, regardless of the thorns
that lacerated his flesh, he plunged into a little glade. Two
forms met his gaze&mdash;a man and a woman, or rather a young
girl. She was struggling wildly in his grasp, with her face
toward the point where approached the young miner, and as
she caught sight of him, cried out imploringly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save me, Marcos; save me for the love of our Virgin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sayosa dared not fire, for fear of hitting the maiden, and
leaped forward with an angry howl of rage. But the maiden&rsquo;s
call had alarmed the man, and as he saw Marcos, he
dropped the girl, and with one leap was hidden in the undergrowth,
closed followed by a bullet from the young miner&rsquo;s
pistol.</p>
<p>For a moment Marcos hesitated, but then the sight of the
pale, motionless Carlita, who lay where she had fallen, decided
him, and dropping to his knees beside her, he pressed his hand
to her heart. With a fervent shout of joy he felt it flutter,
and knew that she had only fainted. Quickly filling his <i>sombrero</i>
with the clear, sparkling water, he plentifully sprinkled
her face with it, and in a few moments she opened her eyes,
to his great joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he&mdash;that fearful man? Oh, Marcos, is it you?
I am so glad!&rdquo; murmured Carlita, as she closed her eyes
again, and nestled still to his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not think of it, <i>mi alma</i>,&rdquo; returned Marcos, pressing
a kiss upon her damp brow. &ldquo;He is gone and will trouble
you no more. But that I could not leave you then, he would
be food for the <i>coyotes</i> and <i>zopilates</i> before now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no, Marcos, he is a terrible man. Promise me you
will not seek him; he would kill you!&rdquo; shuddered Carlita.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know him, darling? Tell me how it happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will not fight him? Remember, you are all I
have to love now upon earth, excepting poor father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind now,&rdquo; said Marcos, &ldquo;but tell me how
he came to molest you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the first time he has met me, but never before
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
did he venture to touch me, although he said horrible, dreadful
things,&rdquo; murmured the girl, hiding her face and sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his name?&rdquo; repeated Sayosa, a little sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know it, but I saw him first at the fandango last
month. You remember? He came up and spoke to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, I suspected it!&rdquo; exclaimed the young miner. &ldquo;Was
there no mark by which you would know him; on his face,
I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; a small, dark-blue spot just over his eye&mdash;the left,
I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on; tell me all. It is as I thought; and I spared his
life, the cursed hound!&rdquo; gritted Sayosa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He met me first about two weeks after that, and spoke in
a way that frightened me; as if he&mdash;loved me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you never told me?&rdquo; demanded the miner, a little
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Marcos; I was afraid. You know how
brave you are, and I thought if you knew, you might get
hurt,&rdquo; pleaded Carlita. Then, as he did not speak, she continued
more rapidly: &ldquo;Once afterward I saw him, and he
spoke the same, but I left him without an answer. Then to-day
I was walking along the <i>arroyo</i>, wondering why you did
not come, when he suddenly stepped before me, and as I
turned to run, he frightened me so, he caught hold of my arm
and held me fast. Then he said something worse than all,
that I thought would kill me, and as I screamed he caught
me in his arms and tried to drag me away, when you came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand; but, Carlita, darling, you did very wrong
in not telling me when he first insulted you, and then this
would not have happened. He is a dissolute, unprincipled
villain, and I shudder at what might have been your fate if I
had not arrived as I did,&rdquo; chided Sayosa. &ldquo;But come, let us
go to the house. Is <i>tio Tomas</i> at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He went away just before noon, but he should be
back by this time,&rdquo; and then they crossed the <i>arroyo</i> on a
foot-bridge, of a tree that had been felled over to span the
little stream, and approached the house, or rather <i>jacale</i>, for
it was no better.</p>
<p>Its walls were composed of the split trunks of the arborescent
yucca, set stockade fashion in the ground, while its roof
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
was a thatch furnished by the long, bayonet-shaped leaves of
the same gigantic lily. The interstices between the uprights,
instead of being &ldquo;chinked&rdquo; with clay, as is common among
the lower class of peasants, was wattled with a species of
heavy grass or reed.</p>
<p>The form of a man, old and enfeebled from age and sickness,
sat upon a rude stool just within the doorway, smoking
a pipe, slowly ejecting the fragrant vapor through his thin
nostrils, his head leaning against the side of the door, with
closed eyes and a faint smile of intense enjoyment playing
around his mouth that told plainly he was a lover of the narcotic
weed.</p>
<p>If looks were a criterion, he was already past the age allotted
to man. His face was one mass of wrinkles; the hair
was white as snow, and made but a thin, narrow fringe around
his crown, like the shaven poll of a monk. He had been
very tall, but now his form was like a bent bow, the chin resting
upon his chest, giving him the appearance of being humpbacked.
Such was Tomas Ventura, better known as <i>tio</i>, or
uncle Tomas.</p>
<p>The wolf-like dog that lay at his feet leaped up and ran to
welcome the young couple, arousing the old man, who, when
he saw what was the cause, signified his pleasure by rubbing
his bony hands together and calling out in a shrill, cracked
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Marcos, my son, you are as welcome as the first drop
of rain. But where have you been so long? and see, the
boy is hurt! Look at the blood. Is it bad, Marcos, is it
bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few scratches, <i>tio</i> Tomas, nothing more,&rdquo; was the hasty
reply, for he noted the sudden start of alarm given by Carlita,
who had been so excited by the adventure she had met with,
that she did not notice he had been wounded before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how was it, child, how did it happen? In a duel?&rdquo;
persisted Ventura, with the curiosity of old age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; hesitated Marcos, for it was partially from that
cause, as the reader knows, but he did not wish Carlita to
learn of that just at present; &ldquo;it was with the <i>Melladios</i>.
They attacked us of the Scarlet Shoulders night before
last.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the accursed dogs! But you beat them; say that
you beat the cowardly <i>ladrones</i>!&rdquo; eagerly cried the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, that we did!&rdquo; laughed Sayosa, &ldquo;and so thoroughly
that they will rest satisfied for a year to come. But, dear
Carlita, you must change your clothes. It is getting chilly,&rdquo;
he added, as they entered the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Santissima Virgin</i>, she is all wet! Did you fall into the
<i>arroyo, nina</i>?&rdquo; anxiously queried Ventura, for the first time
noting the condition of his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not that, uncle, but worse,&rdquo; returned Marcos. &ldquo;Come
out of doors and I will tell you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few words he narrated the insult given by Estevan
Despierto, the duel, and then his dastardly conduct to Carlita,
with the assault from which she had just been delivered; for,
from the peculiarity mentioned by Carlita, he had recognized
Despierto as the villain. The blue spot, left by a pistol-shot
that had been discharged so close to his face that the burnt
powder had penetrated the skin, was an indelible brand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Madre de Soledad!</i> and I so near!&rdquo; murmured the father.
&ldquo;So near, and not know of my child&rsquo;s danger! But he
did not&mdash;you saved her from all harm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excepting a bad affright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God it was you. But listen. My Carlita is beautiful
and good&mdash;even a father may say that&mdash;and she loves
you, better far than life itself. And you&mdash;can you, do you
love her?&rdquo; anxiously asked Ventura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I do, I <i>will</i> love her, best of all!&rdquo; exclaimed Marcos,
but there was a remonstrance at his heart; the bright, beautiful
face of Luisa Canelo was there, and seemed to reproach
him for the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hoped so&mdash;I <i>knew</i> so; and I am glad. I am an old
man, Marcos, and, as you know, very poor. But you saved
my daughter; she who looks at me with her mother&rsquo;s eyes,
and I shall not forget it. Listen. I can not live much
longer; I feel that I must soon die, although it is sorrow and
care&mdash;remorse, not age, that has made me what I am. I am
not much over fifty years of age, but I look nearer a hundred.
You wonder, but it is true. And when I die&mdash;after
I am dead, you will be rich. Yes, rich as a prince&mdash;a prince,
Marcos!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that now, uncle; we will talk it over some
other time. Let us return to the <i>jacale</i>,&rdquo; soothingly replied
Sayosa, as he took the old man&rsquo;s arm, thinking that the tale
of Carlita&rsquo;s peril had shocked his brain; for the neighbors all
called him &ldquo;crazy Ventura,&rdquo; and the youth partially shared
their belief that the old man was of unsound mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Marcos, my son, you are wrong,&rdquo; said Ventura.
&ldquo;I am not wandering; my brain is not crazed. Although
the blessed Virgin knows that I have endured enough to
make me so. I am speaking the truth when I say that if you
marry Carlita, after I am gone, you will be wealthy; with
gold that you could not count in a lifetime, and lands where
you may gallop all day long, in a straight line, without touching
an inch of ground that does not call you master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let us go to the house, for I am fearfully hungry.
I have not eaten a mouthful of food since last night,&rdquo; lightly
returned Sayosa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Por Dios</i>, is it so? Then come, hasten; my poor boy,
you must be starving,&rdquo; cried Ventura, and the two men were
soon eating a hearty meal, prepared by the little brown hands
of Carlita.</p>
<p>She was a tiny, fairy-like creature, but with an admirably
modeled form, of exquisite grace and beauty. She had the
large, lustrous black eyes that are seen only to perfection in
Mexico, but more especially in the valley of Jalapa. Her
hair was worn rather short, curling in masses around her
small head and graceful neck, glossy as the plumage of a
raven, and with the same blue-black sheen. Her arms, hand,
tiny-slippered foot and trim ankle were matchless even among
the ones to whom such charms are hereditary. And although
so young in years, but little past her <i>buen quince</i> (beautiful
fifteen), she was a fully-developed woman. Those years passed
under the sun of a Southern sky are what two or three and
twenty are in our temperate climate.</p>
<p>Her father had appeared at their present situation when she
was yet an infant, and although, from the great contrast between
the two, it was hinted they were not of such close relationship,
yet he was her father.</p>
<p>With them had come a boy, Marcos Sayosa, who had been
taught to call the one uncle and the other cousin. But when
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
he grew older and began to ask about his parents, Tomas
Ventura told him that he was not a nephew, or, indeed, any
relation whatever. That a man and woman had come to his
house, asking shelter, where he had been born. The father
was badly wounded in the conflict with banditti in which
they had lost their all, excepting the clothes they wore, and
had managed to escape and wander to his hut. The man
died of his wounds, and after Marcos&rsquo; birth his mother sunk
rapidly from grief for her husband, and on the third day she
also died. They were buried side by side, and Ventura determined
to adopt the child, calling it after its father&rsquo;s name,
and had done so, rearing him as though he was of his own
flesh and blood, although it was a constant struggle with him
to obtain food for the mouths of those dependent upon him.</p>
<p>This was the story that Marcos had heard. Who or what
his parents were he could not learn. They had been robbed
of every thing&mdash;not even a scrap of paper was to be found&mdash;and
in their woful condition Ventura had not ventured to
question them; and no clue, excepting the one name, was
dropped from their lips.</p>
<p>With this Sayosa was forced to be content, and as his years
increased, he learned to love the sweet Carlita, and she him.
They were pledged to each other, and until the hour in which
he met Luisa Canelo, he had thoughts for none other. But
now he was bewildered, and knew not what to do. Although
he declared to himself that he loved Carlita, and her only,
his thoughts would wander to Luisa, and her image was far
oftener present to his mind than he would have cared to
admit.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br />FELIPE&rsquo;S VISITOR.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Pepe, what is it?&rdquo; a little impatiently asked Felipe
Canelo, as a <i>vaquero</i> paused at the entrance of the little arbor
within which he was seated with Luisa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Un papelaio, mi amo</i>,&rdquo; respectfully answered Pepe, as he
presented a folded note to the young man, and then resumed
his former position as it was being perused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Luisa&rsquo;s eyes were fixed upon her brother&rsquo;s face, and the
change in it was so sudden and strange, that she could not
suppress an exclamation of alarm. His face blanched to an
ashen white, and his form shook as though he had an ague-fit,
while there was a wild, half-crazed glare in his eyes, that
frightened her, she scarce knew why. But the sound of her
voice recalled Felipe to his senses, and with an effort he regained
his composure sufficiently to speak coherently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing, Luisa, darling. It is from an old friend that
I thought was dead, and the unexpected sight of his name
shocked me; that is all,&rdquo; he muttered, as stooping, he pressed
a kiss upon her cheek. &ldquo;But, Pepe, where is the gentleman
who gave you this; I must see him,&rdquo; he added, as he saw that
the <i>vaquero</i> still stood at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He awaits you at the first clump of <i>magueys</i> on the <i>arroyo
maduro</i>, <i>senor</i>, just below the ford. I met him there and he
asked me to give you <i>el papelaio</i>. But pardon, master, shall I
not go with you? He is a wild, rough-looking person, more
like a <i>salteador</i> than an honest man,&rdquo; urged the <i>vaquero</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Pepe; he means no mischief, and even if he did, it
is not one man who would get the better of me,&rdquo; laughed
Felipe, but it was in a constrained manner. &ldquo;Go now, and
saddle Peralta, and fasten him at the gate. I will be there in
five minutes. Come, Luisa, let us return to the house,&rdquo; he
added, taking her arm and leaving the arbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Felipe&mdash;brother, do not go to that man. I know that
something dreadful will happen if you do,&rdquo; pleaded Luisa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I <i>must</i> go, or he would come here, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that would be better; then where there were so many
around, he would not harm you,&rdquo; interrupted the maiden,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the world would&mdash;I mean it would not be pleasant,
sister; at least, just at present,&rdquo; stammered Felipe.
&ldquo;And there is no danger. Besides, I shall go armed. So
say no more about it, and when I come back we will laugh
heartily over your foolish fancies,&rdquo; he added, lightly.</p>
<p>Luisa said no more, for she saw that he was determined to
go, and in a few moments he was in the saddle, well armed,
and galloping swiftly toward the point designated. As he
rode up, he uttered the shrill, thrilling whistle of the red-tailed
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
hawk, and in a few moments the signal was answered from
the grove of <i>moquet</i>, and a horseman rode from out among
the underbrush that surrounded the tall plants.</p>
<p>He was a tall, stalwart man, with features regular enough,
but upon them was the brand of crime and fearful passion.
Pepe, the <i>vaquero</i>, had spoken truly when he described the
stranger as a &ldquo;wild, rough-looking man.&rdquo; He was such a
man as one would instinctively shun if in a lone place, and
feel more at ease when he was out of sight.</p>
<p>The two men, so dissimilar in appearance, were soon deeply
engaged in consultation, and did not notice that there was an
intruder near them, and one, too, that was listening eagerly
to their every word, his countenance betraying the intense
interest it occasioned him. He was concealed behind a dense
stunted bush, or rather <i>in</i> a little clump, not more than a score
of feet distant, with his eye at one opening and ear at another,
carefully parting the leaves with his hands, so as to hear everything,
while the slightly-fluttering leaves fully screened his
face from view.</p>
<p>That it was a secret topic they were discussing was
plainly evidenced by the continual glances that were cast
around them, as if to guard against espial or interruption,
but they were directed beyond where the spy was crouched.
Perhaps an hour afterward the two men separated, Felipe
riding homeward slowly, the stranger galloping rapidly off
toward Guanajuato.</p>
<p>When they moved out of sight the spy arose, and looking
toward the point where the latter had disappeared, clenched
his fist and shook it vindictively, hissing between his closed
teeth as he did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beware, Senor Don Lopez Romulo. I know you now,
and your precious secret! And I will foil you, so sure as
the sun shines; yes, and test my <i>cuchillo</i> on your ribs before
many days. <i>Santissima Virgin!</i> can it be true?&rdquo; he added, in a
changed voice, as he sat down again, and resting his head
upon his hand, sunk into a deep fit of musing that lasted until
the sun had set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that will do, I think. At least I will try. But Don
Felipe? <i>Sangre de Christo!</i> it must be so; else they would
not have been so cautious. Poor Senora Canelo!&rdquo; he muttered,
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
as he strode rapidly toward the <i>hacienda</i>, taking a roundabout
course, so as to enter it upon the opposite side from
that whence Felipe had ridden.</p>
<p>It was at an early hour of the night of the succeeding day
to that on which Felipe had met his strange visitor, that this
same man, or Lopez Romulo as the spy had termed him, entered
a low, fifth-rate <i>cabaret</i> near the suburbs of Guanajuato.
His soft, felt hat was slouched over his eyes, and the muffling
folds of his coarse woolen <i>bayeta</i> shrouded the lower
portion of his face, only leaving a narrow aperture, from which
gleamed a large black eye. After a quick glance around
the room, he dropped his cloak, and spoke to the <i>patrone</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor Don Sanchez, if a <i>cavallero</i> asks for me by the
name you know, be so kind as to direct him to my table.
Stop. Have you any acquaintance with Don Sylva Cohecho?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carajo! yes; more than I could wish. He owes me for
two nights&rsquo; drinking, and what a head he has got, to be sure!
He said you would see me paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good. Include it with my bill. Send a bottle of
wine and some cigarettes&mdash;not like the bundle you gave me
the other day, or I will ram them down my pistol and use
your head for a target.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I comprehend your excellency,&rdquo; grinned the <i>patrone</i>, significantly.
&ldquo;You were a stranger then, and I did not expect
to see you again. It was all in the way of business, you
see. But no offense, I trust?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None. You rob the traveler in one way, I in another;
ha, ha!&rdquo; laughed Romulo, as he passed to the further end of
the vacant room, where he seated himself at a small table.</p>
<p>The host, when he brought the ordered articles, removed
the two nearest stands to a distance, so that any thing said in a
moderate tone by Lopez or his expected friend could not be
overheard. After the elapse of an hour, perhaps, half of
the tables were occupied, and then Sylva Cohecho, the repulsive-looking
scoundrel who had betrayed Marcos Sayosa
and his comrades of the Scarlet Shoulders to the <i>Melladios</i>,
entered, and was directed to where Romulo was sitting. He
was greeted with a careless, half-contemptuous nod by the
latter, who did not deign to move the cigarette from between
his lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wished to see me, <i>&rsquo;nor capitan</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On business, yes; for pleasure, no,&rdquo; returned Lopez,
not noting the flash of anger that shot from beneath the
shaggy, pent-house eyebrows of his comrade. &ldquo;I have work
for you to do, of that kind which pleases you the most. There
is a certain man that I wish put out of the way; a blow of
the <i>cuchillo</i> will do. And the sooner it is done the greater
will be your pay. He has deeply insulted me, and as it was
at a place and time that I could not resent it then, I ask you.
But that matters not. When you have done this, we will
be ready to begin the business that brought us here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the person&rsquo;s name is&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One Marcos Sayosa, a miner of Los Rayas, and, I have
heard, the chief of those who call themselves Scarlet Shoulders,&rdquo;
returned the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, and at the same time I can discharge the little
sum he owes me!&rdquo; exclaimed Cohecho, clutching his long
knife vindictively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you know him, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For reply Don Sylva narrated the adventures of the night
on which he had played the spy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your headstrong folly will ruin both yourself and my
plans, yet; not that the first would matter much, because
the sooner the <i>zopilates</i> feed upon your hideous carcass the
better; but until this affair is over, remember your life belongs
to <i>me</i>, and you must keep as much in the dark as possible.
Supposing some of those miners should meet you again&mdash;for
they will not soon forget such a marvel of grace and beauty
as you are&mdash;their first greeting would be either a stab or a
pistol bullet,&rdquo; angrily muttered Lopez, as he refilled his
glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Carrai!</i> but that&rsquo;s a two-handed game,&rdquo; returned Cohecho.
&ldquo;And they have all returned to work at the mines, so
there is no danger of that. But about this Sayosa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will receive five hundred <i>pesos</i>, if you bring me satisfactory
proof that he is dead; but beware how you act. If
you try to deceive me, I wear a knife that has stilled the
breath of better men than you, and perhaps you know my
hand never misses its aim,&rdquo; answered Romulo, significantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Voto al demonios,&rsquo;nor capitan</i>, where is the need of threats?
Have I ever played you false?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to my knowledge. If you had, you would not be sitting
here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is your enemy, and mine also. I shall claim the
money within the week, perhaps before another night. But
the other&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is an altogether different affair. You will be paid for it,
as I told you, just as soon as the work is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Carambo</i>, it is beautiful!&rdquo; murmured the ruffian, in a joyful
tone. &ldquo;After this I shall set up a <i>monte</i> bank, and roll in
gold&mdash;the sweet, darling gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; after, but not yet. Do not let your <i>chiripe</i> turn your
brain or steal away the little sense you have got,&rdquo; sneered
Don Lopez, as he lighted another cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, <i>&rsquo;nor capitan</i>, I was dreaming. But did you see this
Don Felipe Canelo?&rdquo; returned Cohecho.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mil diablos, zarayote</i>, why do you speak that name?&rdquo; exclaimed
Lopez, ferociously. &ldquo;What do you know about
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing at all,&rdquo; drawing a little back from
the table, as if in expectation of an attack. &ldquo;I only
thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Carrai!</i>&rdquo; hissed Romulo. &ldquo;You have no right to think
of any thing or in any way but as I bid you. And the better
you obey me in this, the longer will be your life. <i>Por to dos
santos</i>&rdquo; (by all the saints), &ldquo;if I hear that name from your
thick lips, or hear your tongue even hint at it, I will tear it
out by the roots and feed it to the <i>coyotes</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear you, <i>&rsquo;nor</i> Romulo, and will heed your <i>hint</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that you do. I never warn twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any further orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None; except that you be here to-morrow night, to report
progress in the first affair. Then you can attend to this miner,
Sayosa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Muy bueno!</i> But, <i>&rsquo;nor capitan</i>, I must have some money.
I spent the last <i>ocharo</i> to-night,&rdquo; hinted Sylva.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Voto a brios, picaro</i>, do you think I am a gold mine?&rdquo;
fumed the choleric Lopez. &ldquo;Here, take this, and be a little
less free in your riotings,&rdquo; at the same time shoving six golden
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
<i>onzas</i> over to the other, who eagerly clutched them, saying, as
he slipped them, one by one, into his pocket:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wrong me, master. Remember, there are many little
bribes to give that I can not avoid, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To say nothing of the <i>Chinas</i>,&rdquo; interrupted Lopez, as he
arose from the table. &ldquo;But remember; be diligent, and meet
me here at this hour to-morrow night,&rdquo; and he turned away,
without a look of recognition for the obsequious bow of the
unabashed ruffian, who then resumed his seat with an air of relief,
darting a venomous glance after his master, and refilling
his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you may strut and put on airs for a while longer, you
cursed dog, but only for a little while. Let me once receive
my gold, and then&mdash;I will give you a receipt in full! Oh,
won&rsquo;t it be delicious when I am free, and settle your curses
and your jeers with the knife? When I strike you to the
heart, and then, as you gasp out your life at my feet, I will do
as you have threatened me&mdash;pluck out your tongue and thrust
it down your throat! I could die then, perfectly happy. No,
not die; oh, no! I shall be rich then, and with the gold you
give me, I will double and double it, until I can count it by
thousands of ounces! No, no, not die; life would be too
sweet then, and I will live for years&mdash;years of pleasure and
feasting. Oh, the gold, and wine, and women! for them I
will live&mdash;live forever!&rdquo; murmured the hideous ruffian, as he
drank repeatedly from the bottles before him, lost to the present,
busied only with gorgeous images of the future.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />A FEARFUL PERIL.</h2>
<p>It was true, as Sylva Cohecho had stated, that the miners
had again returned to work. The overwhelming defeat experienced
by the <i>Melladios</i> had utterly awed them, and as the
spies sent out by Lucas Planillas returned with the news of
their resuming their everyday occupation, the Scarlet Shoulders
doffed their insignia for the time being, and fell into their old
routine. But there was a code of signals and a plan of communication
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
arranged, by which the band could be collected in
an hour&rsquo;s time, whenever such a step should be deemed necessary.</p>
<p>We must now ask the reader to accompany us to the interior
of the mine of <i>Los Rayas</i>, second only to that of Valenciana,
in the state of Guanajuato. Its history presents a new feature
in the mining system of Mexico, a brief explanation of which
is necessary to a right understanding of the operations of the
mining code.</p>
<p>Over the fertile valleys in the vicinity of Guanajuato the
Cordellera rears its metaliferous crest, whose sides are veined
with lodes of gold and silver, and which delivers to the <i>tarreta</i>
of the miner the immense treasures of the <i>Veta Madre</i>, or
Mother Vein, perhaps the richest lode of silver in the world.
The striking contrast that is visible between the laborer and
the miner is nowhere so apparent as in this portion of the
<i>Bajio</i>, or &ldquo;bottom of the valley.&rdquo; Humble and submissive,
the Indian husbandman is at every one&rsquo;s mercy. The miner,
haughty and independent, takes a higher rank; and this claim
is justified by the importance of the duty which he performs.
Obliged to submit to labor which yields him only limited results,
the husbandman finishes his work in silence; while the
pickax of the miner resounds, so to speak, to the end of the
world, and at every stroke he is continually adding to the
riches of mankind. Prosperity is not long in coming to him.
The slopes of the hills, the ravines, and even the summits of
the mountains swarm with a dense population, among whom
the lucky finders of a new lode scatter their hard-earned money
with a thoughtless liberality, and squander in one day the
earnings of six months. From the French miner, Laberde,
who discovered the &ldquo;Mother Vein,&rdquo; and lavished thousands
upon cathedrals, down to the meanest <i>peon</i>, the history of this
bold workman has been the same.</p>
<p>Fortune is the only God he worships. He goes to his dangerous
occupation as if specially sent there by Divine Providence;
and this proud thought is, by the laws of the country,
highly favored, the privilege according the title of nobility to
the worker in the mines. Even at this day, he can not be dispossessed
by his creditor of his mine, if he can afford to work it.</p>
<p>Besides a knowledge of metals to guide him in his search,
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
the miner must be endowed with a number of rare qualities,
from that vigorous strength indispensable to one who has to
raise heavy burdens, and support all day the enervating fatigue
of underground work, down to activity and pliancy of limb,
united with undaunted resolution and coolness. Sometimes,
after toiling for a month, during which he has barely earned
enough to live upon, in a week, or even in a day, he recompenses
himself for his long privations. The miner then thanks
Dame Fortune. He scatters his gold with a lavish hand, and
returns to his work only when all his gains are exhausted.</p>
<p>When he strikes a <i>bonanza</i>, as a very rich portion of the vein
is called, those who work in <i>partido</i>, or when a share of the proceeds
is given him as wages, what he receives is often enough
to keep him in comfort all his life. But such is not his nature.</p>
<p>Besides the grand shaft (<i>tiro general</i>) Los Rayas has two others
of less magnitude, one of which reaches a depth of nearly eight
hundred feet. The <i>tiro general</i>, remarkable for the diameter of
its shaft, of thirty-four feet, and for its frightful depth, of almost
twelve hundred feet, communicates with three principal galleries,
one above the other. These shafts and galleries, together with
their accessories, form the most complete set of gigantic workings
that are to be found in the country. Of its vast and gloomy
grandeur we shall not speak; better pens than ours have described
them. Nor of the workings continually going on in
their depths.</p>
<p>Marcos Sayosa was there, together with his comrades. The
lighted candles attached to their closely-fitting skull-caps, shining
full upon their muscular, bronzed bodies, trickling with
perspiration produced by labor and the close atmosphere, presented
a weird picture. Just then the hoarse voice of one of
the <i>mandones</i>, or overseers, called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>H&rsquo;la, &rsquo;nor</i> Marcos Sayosa, a gentleman wishes to ascend the
<i>tiro general</i>. Will you go with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ever willing to accommodate, the young miner signified his
readiness, and began the necessary preparation, looking somewhat
curiously at the stranger who was brave enough to risk the
ascent upon his first visit to the mine. Another miner was assisting
him to dress in a sort of jacket and trowsers, of thick
wool, intended to prevent the water, that shot forth in fine rain
at several places along the shaft, from penetrating his clothes.
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
A long stick, or baton, was used to prevent his being dashed
to pieces against the rocks, by the oscillation of the rope, to
which they were fastened by means of a plaited rope made
from the bark of the aloe. Sayosa was about to take the post
of danger, or the upper position, when the stranger spoke, in a
courteous voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, <i>cavallero</i>, but I wish to go first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you know the danger?&rdquo; asked the astonished
miner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly. I have often ascended that of Fresvillo, at
Zacatecas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. If you are willing I am.&rdquo; But he looked
curiously at the stranger, who, however, did not appear to notice
this, as he was attending to his strap.</p>
<p>He was rather tall, well-dressed, and of a handsome form
that was not impaired by his apparent age. Indeed, his lithe,
springy movements did not accord with his long, gray hair
and beard that almost covered his face. The gray skull cap
was drawn close down to his eyebrows, and made the disguise,
if such it was, perfect. For a moment Marcos was slightly
suspicious; but when he heard the voice of the stranger this
was lulled, and he banished all such thoughts.</p>
<p>The signal was now given, and the two adventurers slowly ascended
into the shaft. For perhaps five minutes they advanced
foot by foot, and then the horses above paused for breath.
Each of the men carried a torch in his hand, but the light of
which was rendered faint and uncertain by the damp vapor
that arose from the subterranean recesses.</p>
<p>For a novice it would have been a trying situation, replete
with real and imaginary dangers. Suppose the cable should
break, or the strap in which they sat should slip down the
rope, or become untied? There was no knot at the end to
stop such. And then the fall!</p>
<p>To one the shaft seems to be divided into three distinct
zones. At his feet a thick darkness dimmed the horror of
that gulf which no eye could fathom. The very vagueness of
the danger renders it tenfold more trying, while the white,
tepid vapors arise slowly from the dark bottom, mounting
toward them.</p>
<p>Close around them the torches lighted up with a smoky
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
glimmer the green, slime-covered rocks, cut and torn in all directions
by the pickax and the wedge. As the rope slowly
twisted around, or oscillated from side to side, the rough and
jagged profiles appeared endowed with life, now taking the
form of some fearful monster, or assuming the shape of some
one of the horrible demons with which the fertile imagination
of the miners had peopled the bowels of the earth&mdash;guardian
spirits of the countless wealth, and by the illusion of a fanciful
brain, excited at the novel position, they appeared to be moving
stealthily around to gain your rear, and one half closes his
eyes with the momentary expectation of receiving its leap.</p>
<p>In the upper region a dense column of thick mist pressed
around the circle of light cast by the torches, shutting one
completely out from the light of day. It is a trying ordeal,
even to a strong mind, and yet it has its charm.</p>
<p>Then the ascent was resumed and the visions vanished. The
stranger now lighted a bundle of tow, steeped in pitch, at his
torch, and dropped it down the shaft. Their eyes could
scarcely follow it, as it slowly descended the pit, like a globe
of fire, until it seemed as small as one of those pole stars,
whose light scarcely reaches the earth. Once more the ascent
paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, <i>mi amigo</i>, they pause again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for what?&rdquo; returned Marcos, a little startled at the
changed tones of his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I wished it. We are now just half way from the
bottom. Do you know what would be the fate of a man who
should fall from this distance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His body would be dashed to pieces upon the floor, but
he would not know it. He would be dashed to pieces before
he reached it. But why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, from a mere whim of mine, I suppose,&rdquo; laughed the
stranger, a wild, half-sneering, half-ferocious laugh, that startled
Sayosa, he scarcely knew why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did you wish to pause here? The damp is not
pleasant, and my time is valuable,&rdquo; he asked, a little impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wished to examine the walls, and tell you a little story.
But fear not. I will recompense you for lost time when we
reach the upper world, if we ever do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we ever do&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if the rope should break&mdash;such accidents do occur
sometimes, do they not?&mdash;we would not be in a condition either
to pay or receive, would we?&rdquo; and again that horrible laugh
rung out, echoing from side to side of the pit, and died
away in a hoarse murmur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blessed Virgin have mercy upon our poor souls if
that should happen!&rdquo; uttered Sayosa. &ldquo;But you spoke of a
story. What is that to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, and you shall hear. It is short, but the end will be
most interesting. There were once two young men, who or what
they were you shall soon know. They both loved the same
girl, but one of them was favored before the other. Indeed, the
unfortunate devil had no acquaintance with her, excepting a
chance meeting. She did not even know his name. But he
loved her, nevertheless, with all the fervor of his wild, untamed
heart. And he would have married her, as he vowed when
first they met, but she proudly repulsed him. Ha! you start.
Have you heard any thing of the kind?&rdquo; suddenly asked the
stranger, as he bent forward and looked Marcos full in the
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; hoarsely whispered the young miner, as he glared
at his companion, his suspicions newly aroused, more at the
significant tones than the words he had used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they met again, and once more she scorned his suit.
And then he swore by all the saints that she should be his,
not as a wife, as he first intended, but a plaything&mdash;a toy that
he could cast aside when he was tired of it. But the two
rivals met, and in a duel the poor devil was worsted, by a
mere chance. A few days afterward he was frustrated in an
attempt to carry off this fair damsel, and by this same rival.
And now do you know of whom I am speaking?&rdquo; he hissed,
as he drew a long knife from his bosom, that glimmered in
the torchlight.</p>
<p>The young miner did not speak, although he now knew
who the stranger was, and the horrible fate that was in store
for himself. He felt at his side for the knife he usually wore,
but it was gone. As Estevan Despierto&mdash;for he it was&mdash;noted
the action, he laughed triumphantly, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is gone. I slipped it from your belt before we started
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
up the <i>tiro</i>. And see, I will be merciful. You said, a few moments
since, that the man falling from here would not feel
the blow as he touches the ground. See; I will draw the
edge of this knife across the rope, and down you go&mdash;down&mdash;down&mdash;down!&rdquo;
and he stooped still lower, to do as he said,
the first cut severing one of the large strands.</p>
<p>But his speech had given Marcos time to collect his strength,
and in a situation of such peril one reasons fast. He drew
up his body, and felt with his foot for the noose in which he
had been sitting. As he gained it, the second cut was given,
and with a dull snap the cable parted, the sound mingling
with the ferocious laugh of Despierto. But the crouched
form of the young miner sprung upward, and his sinewy
hands firmly clutched both ankles of his would-be murderer.</p>
<p>It was a movement totally unexpected by the latter, and
the sudden shock nearly tore him from his perch. The torch
and knife dropped from his hands, as the latter instinctively
raised to the cable and gripped it, with the energy of despair.
That fact saved them both, but for how long? How would
it end?</p>
<p>The vibration given to the cable forced it to and fro,
until their forms were nearly dashed against the sharp, jagged
points of the rocks, to touch which would be certain death,
now that the ascent had recommenced, the shock being
evidently regarded by those above as a signal to wind up the
rope.</p>
<p>And they were only half way. Despierto strove with all his
energy to loosen the hold of his enemy, but in vain. Both
feet were fast in the vise-like grip of the young miner, who
knew that if one hand, a finger even, should slip, a horrible
death was inevitable; that he would shoot down&mdash;down
through the vast tunnel, and if not suffocated, be killed upon
the rocks below, perhaps at the very feet of his comrades.</p>
<p>The murderer shrieked wildly, and implored the young
miner to loosen his hold, in his terror. <i>That the plaited strap
of bark, by which alone they were separated from death, was
slipping, slowly slipping, down the smooth, hard cable.</i></p>
<p>It would bear the weight of one; two, it could not. Marcos
fully realized his danger, but what could he do to avoid
it? If Despierto would only allow him, he could climb hand
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
over hand up his body, and cling to the cable above. But he
knew, that if he loosened one hand to clutch higher up, that
the liberated foot would dash his hand from the other ankle.
There was nothing to do but to wait&mdash;wait and pray that the
outer world might be reached before the slip-noose should drop
from the end of the cable.</p>
<p>The young miner fixed his eyes despairingly upon the end
of the rope, where it had been severed by Despierto. The
gloom was dense, but it stood clear as a rush-light to the preternaturally
acute gaze of Sayosa. Slowly, but all too rapidly,
it crawled away from him, until, to his strained glare, it seemed
like a drop of molten gold, millions of miles above him.</p>
<p>Now it has vanished. The body of the disguised miner
conceals it from Marcos, who now feels all the horrors of
the death he contemplates. Each moment it seems to him
that he hears the sudden <i>burr-r-r</i> of the noose slipping over
the end. Oh, the horrors of those few minutes, so short in
time, and long, countlessly long in experience! This hanging,
suspended by a frail cord, between life and death, slowly
nearing the one, while yet the other creeps nigher.</p>
<p>Marcos Sayosa closes his eyes with a shudder. He is brave,
but such a death. Then Despierto utters a wild, piercing cry,
but not of despair; it is one of hope. The mists above them
have vanished, and the blue sky is visible. Oh, blessed sight!</p>
<p>Shriek after shriek they send up for help and as they are
heard, eager, half-frightened faces are seen peering down toward
them. Then the cracking of whips and loud shouts are
heard, and the cable glides swiftly up the <i>tiro</i>.</p>
<p>But see! not three inches hold the bark-strap. With a
hoarse howl, Marcos draws himself up by his arms, and then,
with a desperate spring, he releases his hold. To fail is death;
to succeed is safety and <i>life</i>.</p>
<p>His long, sinewy hands clutched his foe around the neck.
He draws up his feet, and places them in Despierto&rsquo;s lap.
Then grasping the cable, so massive that he can scarcely span
it, he rests his feet upon the shoulders of his companion.</p>
<p>The mouth of the shaft is close at hand, but the bark-rope
now fails. It slipped from the cable, and dropped over the
body of Estevan Despierto, who had grasped the rope with a
death-clutch. A hastily-formed noose is thrown from the side
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
of the shaft. It misses Sayosa and falls upon the upturned
face of the other.</p>
<p>Crazed with terror, he releases one hand to grasp it, thus
sealing his own death-warrant. The smooth, hard cable
slipped through his benumbed hand. He sees his folly and
strives to redeem it; but it is too late. His hand only closes
upon the end that he had severed with a far different intention,
and, as his body swiftly descends the ghastly shaft, one
wild, piercing shriek is all; it was his last breath.</p>
<p>Nearly unconscious, but still clinging tenaciously to the
cable, Marcos Sayosa was rescued from what had seemed certain
death, and then, when he was once more upon the earth,
that he had mentally bidden good-by, he sunk into a deep
swoon, that for a time appeared to be death.</p>
<p>For an hour he remained thus, and the miners had nearly
all rushed up from the bowels of the earth, to learn the cause
of the catastrophe, and who was the victim. The fall had
been heard, but upon inspection, no clue could be gained as
to the identity of the ghastly man that strewed the floor.
The severed end of the cable was found, and from its clean-cut
edges, they knew that foul play had brought on the result.
The old miner, who had witnessed the ascent, came, and, as
he saw that the rope had been cut <i>below</i> the place where the
stranger had been secured, he whispered that the victim was
their comrade, Marcos Sayosa, the chief of the Scarlet Shoulders.
With wild shouts and vows of vengeance, the miners
swarmed up the side shafts to avenge their comrade&rsquo;s murder;
for he was the idol of their mine.</p>
<p>After a time, the young miner was able to relate the story
of his fearful peril and narrow escape; and, from the evidence
of the old miner, that the stranger had taken the upper position,
his statement was not doubted. But when he told the
victim&rsquo;s name, a murmur of surprise and commiseration ran
around the crowd, for Estevan Despierto had been a general
favorite, although not in so high a degree as Sayosa.</p>
<p>As soon as the young miner recovered his strength, from
passing through the terrible ordeal, he resumed his clothes,
and mounting a horse that one of his comrades had brought
for his use, he slowly rode off toward the <i>jacale</i> of <i>tio</i> Tomas
Ventura.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />THE JAROCHO&rsquo;S PRISONER.</h2>
<p>An old, gray-haired man, unarmed and upon foot, was slowly
and wearily walking along a narrow, faintly-defined pathway
that wound, leading up and around a precipitous hill that
might almost be called a mountain. He was dressed in a
travel-stained suit of frayed and torn clothes, that gave him
the appearance of one of the beggars that may be met with in
the province described. His tall and once powerful frame was
bowed somewhat, and he leaned heavily upon his stout staff.
His hands and face were begrimed with dust, and this, added
to a stiff, bristling beard of several days&rsquo; growth, helped to
complete the picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold, <i>vagabundo</i>! what are you doing here?&rdquo; challenged
the voice of a concealed man, and the wayfarer&rsquo;s ears were
saluted by a significant <i>click</i>, so suggestive of an ounce of lead,
as he suddenly paused and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not fire, <i>senor</i> stranger; I am a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there more of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am alone, and, as you see, unarmed,&rdquo; replied the traveler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. But who are you, and what do you seek here?&rdquo;
the challenger added, as he stepped from his covert among the
bushes, and leaped lightly down into the pathway.</p>
<p>He was the <i>beau ideal</i> of a hardy mountaineer, tall, handsome,
and of a fine, stalwart form. His dress was that of a
<i>Jarocho</i> (as all the peasants who reside near the sea-coast and
the country around Vera Cruz are termed), and wore in all its
purity the peculiar costume of this class of men.</p>
<p>A hat of <i>Jipajopa</i> straw, with the broad brim turned up behind;
a fine linen shirt, with a band of fine embroidery half
hidden between frills of cambric, worn without any vest or
coat above it; and a pair of purple cotton-velvet <i>calzeneros</i>, open
at the knee, and falling in two points to the middle of his calf.
A scarf of scarlet China crape was knotted around his waist,
in which hung a straight sword, or <i>cortente</i>, without sheath or
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
guard, the sharp and glittering blade of which sparkled in the
bright sunshine. On his feet were half-boots of stamped Cardovan
leather, heavily spiked with steel. A very valuable, if
only for its gold and silver mountings, carabine was dropped
into the hollow of his left arm, while the thumb and forefinger
of his right hand played with the hammer and trigger, as he
curiously scanned the traveler&rsquo;s face and form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>senor</i> can see that I am a poor, homeless traveler who
has been forced to beg his way from Tabasco, on foot, old as
I am. And I fear me my long journey has been for naught.
I have only one hope left me now, and I seek for Don Serapio
Barana, or if he is dead, any of his old band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! what may be your business with him, or I should say
them?&rdquo; exclaimed the Jarocho, in apparent surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know aught of him? The blessed Virgin grant
that you may say yes!&rdquo; cried the traveler, eagerly. &ldquo;Can you
direct me to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But answer my question first. What is it you
wish to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, then; a few words will tell it. To Don Barana&rsquo;s
band of&mdash;of <i>guerilleros</i> there belonged a man called Tomas
Ventura, and whom I have lost track of for nearly twenty
years. I wish to know whether he yet lives, or if he is dead,
to be shown his grave,&rdquo; hurriedly uttered the traveler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for what&mdash;why should you look for him, who may
have died years since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor, he was my brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother?&rdquo; slowly said the Jarocho, then added, after
a slight pause: &ldquo;Well, I will trust you, as I think you are
honest. I belonged to the band at that time, and think I remember
the man. But there are older men among us, who
may be able to tell you about him, for I was but a boy then.
However, do not hope for too good tidings, for I fear me he is
dead long since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he finished, he drew an ivory whistle from his bosom,
and blew a shrill, quavering peal that echoed through the hills.
In a few moments, two men, attired much as their comrade,
appeared upon the hillside, and, after a short explanation, one
of them took the place of sentinel, while the other two led the
way over a rough path up the hillside, followed by the traveler.
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
Turning a sharp spur in the hill, they passed the foot of
an almost perpendicular cliff, whose face was dotted with
shrubbery and parasitic plants.</p>
<p>The Jarochos led the way by a series of rude steps, partly
the work of nature, partly cut by the hand of man, up the side
of the ascent. It was a precarious footing, but their eyes were
true, and then, when perhaps three hundred feet from the base,
a long line of shrubbery was reached, bordering a ledge of
some ten paces in width, that led into a spacious cavern, hollowed
out of the rock.</p>
<p>Within this natural fort there gleamed several fires, and
further from the entrance burned several rude lamps, either
stuck into a crevice or hanging from the roof. Forms of men,
women and children were walking around the cavern, or lying
by the fires in every attitude of indolent ease, smoking, sleeping,
or playing cards. The flickering gleam of the fires but
imperfectly lighting up the recesses, playing over the picturesque
forms, rendered it a weird, fantastic scene.</p>
<p>A bustle followed the appearance of the stranger, and the
form of a monk, as his robe proclaimed him, advanced from a
rude couch in one corner, and, after a profound obeisance, the
Jarocho introduced the subject of the visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you wish to see this Don Serapio Barana?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If possible, holy father, yes,&rdquo; replied the stranger, in
a respectfully low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say it is to gain news of your brother; are you sure
that you have no other object?&rdquo; persisted the <i>padre</i>, keenly
eyeing the traveler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, your reverence, I have no other object; and I pray
you, if he is yet alive, to direct me to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can not be. He is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead? Alas, then, my poor brother, art thou dead also?&rdquo;
murmured the stranger, in a half-choked voice. &ldquo;But may I
not inquire among these <i>cavalleros</i>, father? They may be able
to give me some clue; but if not, then, if you will allow me,
I will join your band. You smile, but I am worn now by
sickness and fatigue. In a week&rsquo;s time I will engage to stand
up before your best man, with whatever weapon he may
choose, and, my life upon it, I will not be the first to cry
hold!&rdquo; proudly said the traveler, drawing himself up to his
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
full hight, and glancing half defiantly around the crowd gathered
near the entrance of the cavern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A soldier, father, from my fifteenth year until I started in
search of my brother; and if he is no more, I care not what
becomes of me. He was the last of my race, and there is no
one to care or think of me now. But may I question the men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But if what you tell me is true about your accomplishments,
I trust you will hear nothing against your staying
with us. If you lose one brother, you will find five score
as true and good,&rdquo; replied the <i>padre</i>, speaking in a clear, full
voice, and, as the Jarochos cast a quick, significant glance at
each other, he saw that he was understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, holy father,&rdquo; replied the stranger, as he bowed
over the hand that was extended him, and noticing the effect
of the last words. &ldquo;If it were not a sin for me to speak so, I
would say amen to your wish. But first my brother, then myself,&rdquo;
and he was about to turn away, when the priest spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, my friend; as you are about to join our band&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, father; if I do not find my brother Tomas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. But I don&rsquo;t believe you will learn any thing,&rdquo;
and he smiled in a significant manner. &ldquo;It has been so long
since, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, I can but hope for the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your name?&rdquo; added the <i>padre</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Garote Ventura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. When you have questioned the men, come to me,
and I will fit you out as a worthy Jarocho should be,&rdquo; added
the <i>padre</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do not learn of my brother,&rdquo; answered Garote, with a
bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True; if,&rdquo; smiled the monk, as he turned away to his couch,
while the other pursued his inquiries regarding the lost one
with a praiseworthy industry.</p>
<p>He did hear of Tomas Ventura, and if a tithe was true
that was told him, then his brother must have been a wonderful
man, surely. Every Jarocho appeared to recollect him, told
tragic anecdotes in which he was the hero, but all coincided
that he was dead; the only point, however, upon which they
were agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>He was killed by a knife, gun, a fall from his horse, drowned,
hung, by falling over the cliff, drank himself to death; and one
Jarocho even affirmed that upon one night he saw the devil
place the poor fellow astride of his tail, bidding him hold fast
around his body, and then fly through the air, riding upon a
streak of chain lightning. Oh, yes, he was dead of a surety,
and so at length Garote Ventura returned to the <i>padre</i>, and announced
his intention of becoming one of his band of worthies,
which resolve was warmly commended, and the holy father
ordered a general carousal in honor of the new recruit.</p>
<p>As a preliminary, the new member was sent with a score of
others to Manterial, a little hamlet some few miles distant, with
orders to procure all the wine, brandy, and liquor that they
could carry, and if the owners demanded pay, to settle the
score with a <i>cortante</i> or <i>cuchillo</i>, by which proceeding he considered
the novice would be perfectly initiated into the mysteries
of their craft.</p>
<p>Although nothing more serious was shed than some liquor,
the expedition was a success, and when they returned the orgies
were begun. As there was little fear of a surprise, the
sentinels were called in to participate, for no stranger could
scale the precipice, unless in broad daylight, without giving
the alarm, and the rear entrance was securely closed. All
joined in the revelry, even the women and <i>padre</i> Gayferos,
who proved himself a veteran in the art of wine-bibbing; excelling
even among the many experts that were there.</p>
<p>But among them all, there was not one more uproarious, or
who filled his cup oftener, than Garote Ventura. As <i>padre</i>
Gayferos trilled out the last words of a love song, he suddenly
started and glanced around the group. Then pointing to a
low, squat-built man, he roared out in a voice that was not entirely
free from hiccoughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andrez, thou drunken rascal, come hither!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drunken, by the Virgin! &rsquo;Tis pleasure to hear the kettle
call the pot black,&rdquo; muttered the fellow, as he arose to his feet,
and using his arms as balancing poles, staggered toward the
monk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh! what&rsquo;s that you say?&rdquo; demanded the monk, a little
sharply, as his ear caught the words, although he did not fully
comprehend them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish the blessed Virgin would remove this killing
pain in my back, father,&rdquo; stammered the Jarocho. &ldquo;See; I
can not stand upright, and it twinges so that I nearly fall down
from pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abjure the cup, my son, and it will leave you. Oh, if you
could only see yourself now, as I see you, you would feel how
disgraceful is drunkenness. Andrez&mdash;Andrez, take pattern after
me, and you will be a better man,&rdquo; reprovingly quoth the <i>padre</i>,
shaking his head, and looking as solemn as an owl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, holy father, I will. If I ever get less sober than
you are now, may the devil carry me off, as he did old Ventura,&rdquo;
said the fellow, assaying a facetious wink, but which only
had the effect of further distorting his naturally ugly visage.
&ldquo;But your will, father, your will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my thoughts wandered. I was reflecting upon the
sinfulness of poor human nature,&rdquo; and as he murmured, he
poured a pint of wine down the cavity that represented his
mouth. &ldquo;You know where the prisoner is, good Andrez?
Yes. Well, my heart is softened at the sight of our innocent
pleasures, and I wish you to take him this bottle of wine, to
drink our healths in. Poor devil, &rsquo;tis a long time since he
tasted as good. Do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your excellency; but don&rsquo;t you think&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t I, that
is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Carrai, bobo!</i> what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see if the&mdash;the pain in my back, your excellency,
should overcome me, I might fall and break the bottle; which
would be a pity, you know,&rdquo; stammered Andrez, swaying to
and fro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou speakest well, Andrez, my son. Here, take this;
and now go,&rdquo; returned the priest, as he handed the outlaw a
huge leathern bottle.</p>
<p>This was not exactly what Andrez meant, but he knew too
well the fierce temper of <i>padre</i> Gayferos when once he was
aroused, and dared not hesitate longer. But before he had
taken a dozen steps he fell to the ground, rolling over and over
as he assayed to arise. The new member of the Jarocho band
noted this, and he staggered over to the prostrate fellow, and
by dint of much pulling and tugging, managed to raise him
erect once more; and then he muttered, in a low tone:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come, <i>compadre</i>, I will go with you. See; lean on me and
show me the way to turn. So. We will do it finely,&rdquo; as under
Andrez&rsquo; guidance he turned to the left, after taking down
one of the rude lamps, to light their way along the rough, uneven
passage.</p>
<p>When once out of sight of the revelers, Andrez whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Por</i> Bacchus, <i>&rsquo;nor</i> Garote, the <i>padre</i> is cruel in sending us
here, away from the wine. Suppose we drink together? The
prisoner does not need this wine as much as we. Besides, it is
a shame for us gentlemen to wait upon him;&rdquo; he held up the
bottle before him, shaking it and listening to the musical rattle
of its contents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true, Andrez. But who is this prisoner?&rdquo; eagerly asked
Ventura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, ho! that is a secret, that is known only to the holy
father and me. Why, he would burn me alive if I so much as
whispered that our old <i>capitan</i>, Don Serapo Barana, was his
prisoner. No, no, <i>&rsquo;nor</i> Ventura, that is a secret&mdash;a secret, do
you hear? And although you may be a true man, I won&rsquo;t
share it with you,&rdquo; rambled Andrez, with a drunken leer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, I was wrong, as you say,&rdquo; suppressing the exultant
smile that shot over his features. &ldquo;But come, we will go to
the cell, and then, after we have drank the wine, will throw the
bottle inside, so the <i>padre</i> will find it there to-morrow, and then
he will not suspect us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! that is it. Come, your arm. That cursed pain is
in my legs now. The rheumatism in my knee joints, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes more the men were at the end of the passage,
and holding up the lamp, Ventura saw that a massive
wooden door, thickly studded with iron nails, and secured by
a huge lock and two bolts, had been set into the solid rock.
It was a good piece of work, and appeared strong enough to
resist any thing short of artillery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are at last, and, thank the Virgin, that pain has
left me,&rdquo; muttered Andrez, as he dropped to the floor, and began
to remove the stopper of the flask. &ldquo;Come, friend, let
us drink and be merry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, <i>&rsquo;nor</i> Andrez; how do you open the door?&rdquo; asked
Garote.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;With the key, of course,&rdquo; and he cut short his speech
by introducing the mouth of the flask into his own, while
the wine gurgled merrily down his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is it? If you have forgotten it, we must find
it, or else the <i>padre</i> will find us out, after all,&rdquo; added his comrade,
a little anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, see; I carry it in my bosom,&rdquo; said Andrez, as he
pulled it forth, attached to a cord that hung around his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it the right one, do you think?&rdquo; and as he spoke
Garote adroitly cut the string, and placing the key in the lock,
turned the bolt with some effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold, hold, <i>&rsquo;nor</i> Garote! I must let no one touch that but
myself. Hand it here, or, by the blessed Virgin, I will blow
your brains out!&rdquo; shouted Andrez, as he grasped the pistol
at his belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;see, here it is. And now let us drink. Hold,
will you not leave me a drop?&rdquo; as the now satisfied Jarocho
again elevated the flask, and at the same time lowered the
liquor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is delicious!&rdquo; murmured the drunkard, as he
relinquished the bottle and wiped his mouth upon his shirt
sleeve. &ldquo;I wish that the curs&mdash;holy Mother, pardon me, I
mean blessed <i>padre</i> Gayferos would send us upon this mission
every night! Don&rsquo;t you <i>conpairano</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I do! I would not have missed this chance for a
thousand <i>pesos</i>,&rdquo; warmly returned the new member, as he
handed the bottle to Andrez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he send the wine, yes; if not, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Ventura did not reprove his comrade for his
gluttony, but allowed him to drink as freely and often as he
pleased. After a few attempts, ending by missing his mouth,
and pouring the remainder of the liquor down the outside
of his throat, Andrez dropped the flask, and laying his
head upon it for a pillow, closed his eyes. When the loud
music that streamed from his nostrils told that he slept the
heavy sleep of the drunkard, Ventura picked up the light,
and with a steadiness that would have astonished his comrade,
had he seen the movement, opened the door and
entered the little cell.</p>
<p>Holding the lamp above his head, so as to cast its light
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
around him, Garote soon perceived the form of a man crouching
in one corner of the room, his eyes glaring wildly at
the intruder, as if in mortal dread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Santissima Virgin!</i> can this be he, once so proud and
handsome!&rdquo; murmured Ventura, as he scanned the wretched-looking
object before him.</p>
<p>The prisoner started in wonder, partly at the face of a
stranger, but more from hearing the voice of kindness and
commiseration, when he expected curses and revilings, perhaps
blows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he faltered, as he shielded his eyes from
the glare of the lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend, and if you are he whom I think, a rescuer,&rdquo;
returned Ventura.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br />FELIPE&rsquo;S CONFESSION.</h2>
<p>Marcos Sayosa did not escape entirely scatheless from his
frightful peril at the <i>tiro general</i>, where Estevan Despierto attempted
his murder, for the shock had thrown him into a
fever that settled upon his brain. But fortunately it was not
very severe, and in a week&rsquo;s time he was well again, although
somewhat feeble. Still he would not return to his work at
the mine. The adventure had sickened him of that, for the
time being, at least.</p>
<p>Then he recalled his promise to visit the Canelo <i>hacienda</i>,
and thinking that a change of air and scene would do him
good, he determined to redeem it, and so announced to
Tomas Ventura. On the next day the old man told Carlita
to get ready to pay an old friend a visit of a few days. She
knew better than to cross her father, and although wondering
inwardly what new whim he had taken, accompanied him to
Donna Paxuita&rsquo;s house, greatly to that venerable dame&rsquo;s surprise.
But a few words from Ventura satisfied her.</p>
<p>Marcos was also surprised, but still more so when <i>tio</i>
Tomas said that he was going to accompany him upon his
visit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;You need not be troubled, Marcos. I shall not intrude
upon the fine folk, but stop with the servants. There is one
there that I must see, and this may be my only chance; for
I do not believe that my days are to be much longer,&rdquo; he
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw, <i>tio</i> Tomas, you will outlive me yet, see if you
don&rsquo;t. But are you really in earnest about going with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much so that there is but one thing that can prevent
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is <i>death</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, <i>tio</i>, that I wish you would not speak so
much about that? It does not seem right, and gives me
the cold chills whenever you mention the word. Perhaps
because I have stared it in the face so lately,&rdquo; said Marcos,
with a little shrug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be wrong, but it seems to me that before many
days, I, too, shall stand face to face with it; only instead of
evading it, as you did, it will be the victor. I only hope that
it may not be until after I have seen the person I wish. Then
it matters but little, for I know that you will care for Carlita,&rdquo;
solemnly uttered Ventura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Carambo, tio</i>, take a drop of this; it will warm you up and
banish all such idle fancies,&rdquo; as he handed the old man a bottle
of wine from the cupboard against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so idle as you think, perhaps; but we will see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early the next day the two men rode out from the little
timber belt, and set out rapidly upon their journey. They
were well mounted and thoroughly armed, as indeed they
needed to be, for the country then was not the most peaceful
or safe to traverse. They determined to divide the
journey into three days&rsquo; ride, as neither of them was very
strong.</p>
<p>Nothing occurred till the third day of any consequence.
They had halted at about eleven o&rsquo;clock, to lie by during the heat
of the day, under a few small trees that grew beside a spring,
bubbling forth from beneath a pile of sandstone. They kindled
a fire to boil their chocolate, and, not fearing any danger,
were not particular as to whether they burned perfectly dry or
damp wood. In consequence, the smoke, thick and dark, arose
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
in a considerable column above the tree tops before the fire
was fairly started.</p>
<p>It caught the eye of a single horseman, who was riding
along upon the opposite side of the rocks, and, after eyeing it
curiously for a few moments, he slowly advanced in its direction.
Then securing his horse in a small ravine, he unslung
his <i>escopette</i>, and proceeded to investigate the cause.</p>
<p>But of this our two friends were, of course, unaware. They
little suspected that the hunter of blood was so near. Had
a <i>zopilate</i>, that dusky scavenger of Mexico, been sailing overhead,
he would have seen this picture:</p>
<p>The green clump of trees, shadowing the little rill of water
that ran from the sparkling, bubbling spring; the fire lighted
and now bursting into a bright, roaring blaze, with the forms
of two men bending over it, while their horses eagerly cropped
the rich grass that grew hard by. On the opposite side of
the gray rocks he would have seen the dark form of a man
rapidly gliding along with trailed rifle, crouching half way to
the ground, until he had to bend his long arms to keep them
from dragging. This he would have seen, and more. Two
horsemen swiftly approaching the spring upon nearly the same
trail as that followed by Marcos Sayosa and Tomas Ventura,
and consequently closed out from the view of the solitary
stalker.</p>
<p>His instincts would have told him that there was a fair
prospect of his dinner being afforded him, and he would have
hovered over the spot.</p>
<p>The two men were sitting near the fire, engaged in conversation,
when one of the horses stamped his hoof and pricked
up his ears, as though he scented something suspicious.
This did not escape the watchful eye of Ventura, and, as he
followed the direction indicated by the tremulous ears of his
horse, he saw a shaggy head rise from behind a boulder, and
then the bright barrel of a gun as it was leveled toward
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Marcos, there&rsquo;s some deviltry going on!&rdquo; he
shouted out, leaping forward and pulling the young miner
backward to the ground.</p>
<p>Just then the gun cracked, and, with a wild yell of agony,
the old man fell to the ground, writhing and moaning with
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
pain. The bullet that had been intended for Marcos had
passed through his own body. The youth saw the jet of flame-colored
smoke, and regaining his feet, he drew a pistol and
bounded forward to avenge the death of his companion.</p>
<p>The murderer, nothing loth, leaped from behind his covert,
and with one report the two pistols were discharged. Marcos
was untouched, and Sylva Cohecho received but a crease upon
his shoulder, that acted as a spur. Before either could draw
another weapon, they came into collision, and grappled with
each other in a death struggle.</p>
<p>Although Sayosa was a powerful man, and had never before
met his superior, his late illness had weakened him considerably,
and he found, when too late, he was overmatched.
The long arms of his antagonist seemed like bars of flexible steel,
and wound around him, clasping him close to Cohecho&rsquo;s body,
with such force that it seemed as if his ribs were being crushed.</p>
<p>Still, he struggled manfully, and, by being so much taller
than his foe and very active, he managed to keep his feet. But
he was weakening, and his head began to swim. Cohecho
saw his advantage, and did not fail to improve it. Under his
enormous strength the tall, stalwart miner bent and swayed,
until, with a dexterous trip, the murderer threw his antagonist,
falling heavily upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah-ha! my game cock, your spurs are clipped now!&rdquo; he
growled, as he kneeled upon the senseless body, and, drawing
his knife from his bootleg, tore open the shirt upon the young
miner&rsquo;s bosom, so as to gain a fair blow.</p>
<p>When Tomas Ventura fell, he thought that he was mortally
wounded, but when he heard the struggle going on between
his adopted son and Cohecho, he raised himself up on one
hand, fearing lest Marcos, too, should be worsted. He saw
enough to know that, unassisted, this would be the result
and, dragging himself along by his hands, he managed to
reach the guns, although the path was marked with his blood,
and every motion wrung a groan from his lips.</p>
<p>He reached and cocked one of them, supporting it by resting
his elbow upon the ground. Still he dared not fire, for
the chances were as much in favor of his hitting Marcos as
Cohecho. But then the combatants fell, and, as Sylva raised
his knife to give the finishing blow, the <i>escopette</i> cracked and,
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
true to its aim, an ounce ball crashed through the huge, shaggy
head of the hunchbacked monster.</p>
<p>When the smoke shut off his view, Ventura swooned away,
and for a long time all was blank. When he once more
awoke to consciousness, he saw that Marcos was bending over
him, and there were strangers in the glade. Then one of
them approached and stood where the sunbeams fully revealed
his features. Tomas Ventura glared at him wildly for a moment,
and then shrieked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy Virgin, it is he!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is puzzling your brain now, Luisa, darling!
You have been silent for one whole ten minutes by the watch.
Surely something dreadful must be pending.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;was I still? I must have been thinking, Felipe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? Well, as I never heard of your doing such a
thing before, suppose you tell me the subject of your thoughts.
Come, call me your father confessor, and begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speakers were Luisa and Felipe Canelo, who were
walking in the large garden at the rear of the house, that was
surrounded by a moderately high wall. They both looked
somewhat abstracted, and Felipe particularly so, as though
ill at ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know of none that would suit me better than my
handsome, noble brother,&rdquo; she replied, with forced gaiety.
&ldquo;Come, here in the arbor. Let us sit down and I will try to
explain why I am &lsquo;out of sorts,&rsquo; if you will be as frank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I?</i>&rdquo; echoed Felipe, as if astonished at her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, you. Do you think you can blind me? I say
that you have some secret in your mind, and I must know
what it is; so there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sis&mdash;Luisa, tell me what you mean. What is it that you
know?&rdquo; cried Felipe, hoarsely, as he sunk upon the seat at
her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, Felipe, are you ill? You are as pale as a
ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; I am well, quite well. But tell me what you
know&mdash;what you meant by my secret,&rdquo; tightly clasping her
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret&mdash;did I say that? No, Felipe, I was only jesting.
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
Surely, you have no secret from me, your sister, who
loves you so dearly?&rdquo; asked Luisa, gazing up into his half-averted
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure that you do not know&mdash;that you tell me the
whole truth?&rdquo; faltered her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Felipe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, sister. I believe I am mad of late&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ever since that strange man visited you. Dearest
brother, can not you confide your troubles to your mother
and sister? Who should you trust if not those who are so
proud of, and love you so tenderly?&rdquo; pleaded Luisa, pressing
his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I will; but first, dear one, tell me of what you
were thinking a while since,&rdquo; returned Felipe, as he banished
the cloud from his face, and turned toward his sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not laugh at me, brother? Well, it was of that
noble stranger, who so gallantly rescued us from those ruffians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you think of him&mdash;in what way, I
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can scarcely tell. When he first spoke to me, it seemed
as though I had often heard his voice before, and when he
was silent, the words were repeated over and over in my
heart. And then something seemed to tell me that he was
connected with my future life, and that he would have great
influence over it. But whether for joy or sorrow, I could not
tell. I knew that I should meet him again, and that we
would become very dear to each other, and it was that secret
voice that made me join my request to yours that he would
visit us. I have often thought of this since, and tried to explain
it to myself, but can not. We have not seen or heard
of him since, and yet I know that he will come, that he will
be here soon, and that my feeling will be explained. But
how, or in what manner, I can not tell. I only know that it
will be so!&rdquo; murmured Luisa, in a dreamy, half-musing tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall <i>I</i> explain this miracle, Luisa?&rdquo; asked Felipe,
bitterly, as he dropped her hand, and drew a little back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It you can, oh, if you can, dear brother!&rdquo; exclaimed the
maiden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have solved many an enigma far more difficult than this
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
one of yours, child. You say that you know this young
miner will come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will; I feel it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what would you say, my sister, if he should come to
you and ask you to be his bride&mdash;to mate with <i>him</i>, the digger
in the earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Felipe, what do you mean? You frighten me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This. I mean that this Marcos Sayosa loves you. And
more; that you love <i>him</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed Canelo, bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, brother, surely you are wrong. He does not love me,
nor do I love him&mdash;in the way you mean. And yet he <i>is</i>
very dear to me; I know it, and perhaps I <i>do</i> love him. I
don&rsquo;t know; it is so strange&mdash;so sudden; you have frightened
me!&rdquo; cried Luisa, burying her face in her hands, and
sobbing convulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, sister&mdash;dear Luisa; I was mad&mdash;cruel, to
speak so fiercely,&rdquo; exclaimed Felipe, gently raising her head,
and wiping the tears tenderly away. &ldquo;See, let this be my
apology,&rdquo; softly pressing a kiss upon her brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Felipe; I was very foolish,&rdquo; smiled Luisa,
through her tears, &ldquo;but I could not bear that you should
speak harshly to me. I may love this stranger; perhaps I do,
as you say so; but rest assured that I love you far better&mdash;a
thousand times better than him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could believe that you would say this after you have
heard my confession, then I would be happy&mdash;oh, so happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Felipe. Surely, you can say nothing to change
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you do not know. You will hate me, scorn me, if I
tell you my secret!&rdquo; he murmured, despondingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Felipe, can not you trust me?&rdquo; asked Luisa, reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; I will&mdash;I <i>must</i>. It burns my heart and racks
my brain until it seems as though I would go mad! But our
poor mother; how will she bear it? Holy Virgin! at times
I am tempted to kill myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, brother&mdash;dear Felipe; you frighten me when you
look that way,&rdquo; murmured Luisa, shrinking back a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frighten you, my angel? Not for worlds!&rdquo; and he
bent forward to bestow a kiss, when he suddenly started back.
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
&ldquo;No, no, not now. If ever my lips touch yours, the offer
must first come from you, not me. It were a sin now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Felipe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait. Do not speak or look at me. If you should, my
courage will fail me. Wait until I have finished my confession,
and then&mdash;you shall judge me. Luisa, if you loved a
man with such love as you should feel for a husband, and he
should be guilty of a sin, a great crime, what would you do?
Would you hate and despise him, and tell him to begone
where you might never look upon his face again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if he repented, Felipe, and acknowledged his sin of
his own free will. No. If I loved a man as you say,
brother&mdash;if I loved him as I do <i>you</i>, his fate should be mine.
Where he dwelt, there would be my home; in all things we
would be but one. If the world neglected or scorned him, I
would try and make him forget all&mdash;all except that to me he
was dearest of all. Do you understand me? I can not say
what I would, but you can guess what I mean,&rdquo; exclaimed
Luisa, as she drew nearer to Felipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Luisa, not yet; wait until I have told all, and then
if you forgive me, put your hand in mine. But think well.
If you do, it will be mine&mdash;mine forever! But now, listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luisa, <i>I am not your brother, but am an impostor</i>! Stay. Do
not speak yet; let me finish, now that I have said the worst.
But as the blessed Virgin knows, I thought that I was when
I first came. In that, at least, I am innocent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story that I told you and moth&mdash;<i>your</i> mother, was
all true, so far as concerned myself. I was raised among
your uncle&rsquo;s band of Jarochos, and taught to consider myself
an orphan. Who or what my parents were, I could never
learn. They either did not know, or would not tell me. As
I grew older, I learned how wicked were the ways of my
comrades, but I could not resolve to leave the only friends
that I had ever known, and still continued with the band.
But I did not join them upon their plundering excursions, and
managed to live fairly by selling the game I killed, or its
hides. Then, as I told you, when I returned from one of my
excursions, I found our captain, or your uncle, lying wounded
unto death; and then he told me who I was, giving me the
letter to carry to your mother and whom he swore was also
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
my parent. God help me, I did not dream that a dying man
would so perjure himself, and I believed all that he told me!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how I was received, and that your mother
was struck by my resemblance to your dead father, even before
the letter was opened. But I can not dwell upon that
now&mdash;now that I have lost it all. Then came the note that
so astounded me, when I left you here, to meet the writer,
who was none other than the lieutenant of the band to which
I had belonged. I met him, and then, for the first time, I
learned the plot of which I had been made the instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me that I was not your brother; that he was
dead, and showed me a letter from your uncle saying as
much. He then offered me my choice. Either to pay two
thousand <i>onzas</i> each year, and he would be silent, otherwise
he would expose the imposition to Senora Canelo. What
could I do? That which was right, you say; but I could
not. Holy Mother, forgive me, I promised the villain that I
would submit to his demands, and in that was my sin, or
part of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other was in receiving the caresses of you two&mdash;ladies,
that belonged to a relation&mdash;not to me, the impostor. But my
punishment was begun, even then. How could I look you
in the face, and know, that if you only realized what a
wretch I was, in reality, that you would as soon place to
your lips a plate of red-hot iron, as to have kissed me. Can
you guess how the words, &lsquo;<i>mother&mdash;sister</i>,&rsquo; choked me as I
was forced to utter them. But that was not all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I found that you were not my sister, the love that
I had thought a brother&rsquo;s grew stronger and more painful, until
I found that I loved you as only a man can love once in
his lifetime. God knows how I strove to subdue it, and
crush it out from my heart; but could I? Ah, no; it grew
from day to day, hour to hour, until it became my master.
It showed me the crime that I had contemplated, and at
last I resolved to confess it, and then fly from the spot where
I had been so happy, but I must again make miserable!&rdquo;
concluded the young man, as he covered his face with his
hands, and wept the bitter tears of one whose soul is rocked
with agony.</p>
<p>For a few moments Luisa set as if petrified, so sudden
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
and unexpected had been the shock. But then the wild look
passed from her eyes, and as they dimmed, her hand stole
slowly along and rested upon that of him whom she had believed
her brother. As he felt the light touch he shrunk
away, as if it had been a serpent, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, Luisa; do not touch me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Felipe, do you remember what you said a while since?
<i>Here is my hand</i>,&rdquo; whispered the maiden, as she again touched
his hand with hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luisa, think what you do. If I take your hand, remember
that it is for ever; as that of my wife!&rdquo; cried Felipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still I say, take it, Felipe&mdash;must I say it? <i>I love you!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br />IN THE CAVE AND OUT OF IT.</h2>
<p>As the Jarocho&rsquo;s prisoner heard these words spoken by
Garote Ventura, he approached, but with the hesitating step
of one who doubts, while yet he hopes. The glow of the
lamplight shone full upon him, and Ventura&rsquo;s eyes quickly and
keenly scrutinized his form and every feature.</p>
<p>In stature he was tall, unusually so, and although now
greatly emaciated, had once been a robust and powerful man.
The muscles of his arms and chest still stood out like bands
of steel, showing plainly through the tatters that served him
for clothes. Although his hair was thickly threaded with
silver lines, his form was not yet bowed, nor the fire quenched
in his large, keen black eyes.</p>
<p>The remnants of his former beauty could still be discerned&mdash;the
proud, well-cut profile and noble features, although marred
somewhat by grims and wrinkles, were yet plain enough for
any one who had known him in better days, to be enabled to
recognize him now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend, and if you are he whom I think, a rescuer,&rdquo;
Garote Ventura had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Virgin grant that I may be! But it can not be. A
friend to me, and here? No, no, I was foolish to think so,&rdquo;
bitterly exclaimed the prisoner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; added Ventura. &ldquo;I think you are the one
I seek, and if so, in an hour&rsquo;s time you may be far from here,
if you wish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I wish it!&rdquo; echoed the captive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But tell me who you are. Stop. If you are he
whom I mean, you have committed fearful crimes. But you
have reparation in your power; and if you perform it faithfully,
I think I may promise that you can live in peace, to go
whither you will,&rdquo; he added, impressively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask my name. If it were stained with a tenfold
blackness, I would speak it, in the chance of escaping from
here. And yet it was a noble one once, until <i>I</i> defiled it! I
am, or <i>was</i>, Agustin Canelo,&rdquo; answered the prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so. But, holy Mother of Mercy, what a change!&rdquo;
murmured Garote, as he gazed at the man. &ldquo;It is good. You
are the man that I seek, and I will keep my word, although
you murdered my master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your master? Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look. You should know me. I have not changed so
much. Think; can you not remember the time that I used
to carry you upon my back, playing horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tadeo Campos?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am Tadeo Campos. But we have no time to lose.
Remove your rags, while I haul in this drunken scoundrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few moments Andrez was pulled inside the cell, and
his clothes donned by the prisoner, although not without some
difficulty, for they were several sizes too small. Tadeo Campos,
as we must now call him, relocked the door from the inside,
and coolly seated himself upon the body of Andrez,
much to the surprise of Canelo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you stop here, Campos? Every moment seems
an age until I am free from this cursed hole once more,&rdquo; impatiently
exclaimed the latter, fingering nervously the weapons
that he had taken from the drunken Jarocho.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For two reasons. One is, that it is best to give the
gentlemen outside a little more time to swill their wine, for,
unless their wits are somewhat foggy, you would never pass
for our dumpy friend Andrez, here. And the other, is to do
justice to your brother&rsquo;s family&mdash;to prove who their son is.
Will you promise to do this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will; any thing so that I can get away from this hole
and the tortures of that cursed <i>padre</i> Gayferos. But, supposing
the <i>boy</i> is dead?&rdquo; added Canelo, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be. But the one you sent is an impostor, at any
rate. But we will settle that afterward. Will you do all
that lays in your power to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; emphatically replied the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it may be so, but I am a cautious man by nature,
and experience has doubled it. If you will swear to tell the
entire truth, to answer fully and explicitly all questions that
may be asked you&mdash;if you swear this, I say, and kiss the
holy cross, I will set you free. If&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will raise the alarm, and you may do the best
you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough, I will swear it,&rdquo; hastily said Canelo.</p>
<p>The crucifix was produced, and the required oath taken,
when Tadeo said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you remain here while I go and reconnoiter. If
all is right we will be free in half an hour. But blow out the
light, as it might be seen as I open the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will come back?&rdquo; faltered Canelo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I meant to betray you or do you harm, would I have
taken all this trouble?&rdquo; returned Campos, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, good friend; I am sadly changed from what I
once was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>capataz</i>, after extinguishing the light, softly opened
the door and stepped forth. Then he saw the wisdom of
having put out the light, for, just turning the nearest angle,
he saw a man bearing a light, and then recognized it to be
none other than <i>padre</i> Gayferos. He only paused long
enough to note that the worthy priest had imbibed such a
quantity of the confiscated wine, that he was laying off a
somewhat irregular pattern for a &ldquo;Virginny rail fence,&rdquo; and
muttering incoherently to himself. Then he slipped inside
the cell, and after silently locking the door, told his companion
of the approaching visitor.</p>
<p>Canelo shuddered and shrunk back as if in fear, so great
had been the tortures that he had endured at the monk&rsquo;s
hands, when unable to resist. But as his hand touched the
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
knife at his waist, this vanished&mdash;the sudden change boding
ill for the enemy, should he fall into the ex-prisoner&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>They both stood close to the door, and soon heard the
tipsy priest fumbling at the lock for some time before he
could fit his key into place, cursing fearfully at every breath.
But at last the bolt yielded, and he kicked the door wide
open. Canelo sprung forward with a howl like a wild beast,
and clutched the monk by the throat, while Tadeo grasped
the lamp.</p>
<p>The two foes fell to the ground, and by some means the
light was dashed from Tadeo&rsquo;s hand, and shattered to pieces
upon the rocky floor. He turned to light the other, for he
could do nothing in the dark, and knew that their safety
depended upon the monk&rsquo;s capture without an alarm being
raised. A few moments sufficed for this, but when he
turned the light upon the two men, a horrible, sickening
sight met his gaze.</p>
<p>The half-crazed Canelo was kneeling upon the breast of
<i>padre</i> Gayferos, brandishing a gory knife in one hand, while
the other clutched his victim&rsquo;s throat. He had slit the unfortunate
man&rsquo;s mouth from ear to ear, and actually torn out
his tongue by the roots, and then thrust it down his throat!</p>
<p>Acting on the impulse, Tadeo leaped forward and knocked
Canelo from his victim&rsquo;s body, and then buried his long knife
to the hilt in the priest&rsquo;s breast, at once putting an end to his
tortures. As he turned, it was just in time to avoid the rush
of Canelo, and elude the vicious plunge of a <i>cuchillo</i>, that
slit open the clothes upon his side. Then, before the mad
man could turn, he was upon his back, driving him head
first to the floor; when, placing a knife at his throat, Campos
hissed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mil diablos</i>, ingrate! Is that my reward for risking my
life to save yours? By the Virgin of Atocha, I have a mind
to serve you the same trick that you did the <i>padre</i>, cursed
dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was mad, good Campos, and knew not what I did. And
if you only knew the tortures that man has subjected me to,
you would praise not blame me. But let me up now. It has
passed and I am myself again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will. But look you. If you make a motion toward
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
me, I will plaster the wall with your brains, as I&rsquo;m a living
man. Do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may. Take my weapons if you will, but let me up.
We must be going. They may discover us, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then; yes, I know,&rdquo; said Campos, as he arose, keeping
a watchful eye upon his companion. &ldquo;Come, drag this
carrion into the cell, and then we will be going. It is time
now, if ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was quickly done, and as the monk was fully as large
as Canelo, he exchanged clothes once more, knowing that he
would run less risk of detection in that garb than the other,
for no one of the Jarochos would venture to address him unless
spoken to first, so great were their fears of the <i>padre</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will lead the way,&rdquo; said Canelo, &ldquo;and you follow close.
I know every inch of the passage, even in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lamp was extinguished, and, after locking the cell door
and retaining the key, the two adventurers stole cautiously
along the passage. The sounds of the outlaws carousing grew
rapidly plainer, and from the number of voices combined it
was plain that Tadeo had either overrated the strength of the
wine, or underestimated the strength of the reveler&rsquo;s brains.
Still they did not despair, but resolved to run the risk at once,
and trust to their good fortune and the priestly disguise to
carry them through, rather than delay longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you risk it?&rdquo; asked Campos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>must</i>. I can imitate the <i>padre&rsquo;s</i> air and motion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember that he was slightly tipsy, and if you shroud
your face and long hair in the cowl, I think there will be no
particular danger,&rdquo; whispered Tadeo, as they paused at the
angle from whence the first glimpse could be caught of the
orgies.</p>
<p>Fully one half of the Jarochos were overcome totally by
their potations, and lay scattered about, regardless whether
they rolled upon the table or beside it, as it was all the same
hight. In some cases they were used for seats, in others as
pillows, and the crowd amply made up in loudness what it
had lost by the decrease in numbers. Men, women, and children
were mixed in one grand, ever-shifting panorama, but indistinctly
revealed by the faint, flickering light.</p>
<p>Making the best of a bad bargain, the two adventurers entered
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
the grand apartment, and reeling in a zigzag course,
proceeded toward the top of the &ldquo;staircase.&rdquo; But they
were destined not to escape without interruption. Tadeo
Campos was recognized (as Garote Ventura), and recollecting
that it was in honor of his having joined the band that they
were carousing, began to call him to come and drink with
them, several of the more sober men rising and staggering
toward the two adventurers.</p>
<p>Then it was that the monk&rsquo;s garb stood them in good stead.
Fearing lest he should be recognized if they approached too
closely, Canelo turned, with his face and head still shrouded
in the cowl, and with a very fair imitation of the <i>padre&rsquo;s</i> voice,
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back to your wine. Our brother Ventura hath something
to confide to me, that may prove of great benefit to the
band. <i>Cuerpo di Cristo!</i> ye dogs, do you hear me? The
one who comes a step nearer will drink no more, for his
head will be all mouth! Back with you, you sacrilegious
thieves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jarochos paused, and then returned to their liquor, for
the steely glitter of the monk&rsquo;s pistol awed the boldest of
them. But there was considerable muttering among them,
and one especially, whose comments were overheard by our
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Venus, the <i>padre</i> is in grum humor all of a sudden. I
guess <i>&rsquo;na</i> Jesusita was not in the mood to be confessed tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wild, boisterous peal of laughter followed this pointed
remark, and Canelo deemed it best not to notice it, although
he well knew what would have been the <i>bona fide padre&rsquo;s</i> answer.</p>
<p>They had now nearly reached the edge of the platform
and were congratulating themselves inwardly upon their happy
escape, when a man arose from the face of the cliff, and meeting
them, at once dropped upon his knees before the disguised
men, murmuring:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your benediction, holy father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This renconter was so sudden and unexpected that Canelo
started back with an exclamation of dismay, and at the same
moment the cowl dropped back from his face. The man
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
looked up, and, as the moonlight shone full upon the ex-chief&rsquo;s
features, he uttered a gasp of terror:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Santissima Virgin!</i> the captain&rsquo;s ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately Tadeo Campos did not lose his presence of
mind, and as the intruder arose he leaped forward, and shot
out his clenched fist, the blow alighting full upon the unprotected
throat of the Jarocho, its terrible force effectually checking
any further outcry, and at the same time hurled him headlong
down the precipice. There was a dull, horrible thud,
and then all was still.</p>
<p>Glancing around at the Jarochos, half expecting to see the
band come rushing in a body to avenge their comrade&rsquo;s death,
the two men grasped their weapons, determined to sell their
lives dearly, if such must be. But to their great joy they saw
that the outlaws were unconscious of the tragedy just enacted,
and then hastily began their perilous descent.</p>
<p>By keeping close to Canelo, and stepping in his footprints,
Campos effected it in safety, and in a few minutes they were
both standing in the firm path at the foot of the precipice.
Then Canelo muttered, in a cautious voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now the next thing is to procure horses, for we can
not go upon foot, as we may be followed at any moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a horse four miles from here, where I left him
at a <i>jacale</i> as I came,&rdquo; returned Tadeo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do better than that. The stable of the band is
not far from here, and in it are the best horses for leagues
around, or was, when I was chief. I do not think that there
can be any guard left there, as it would be almost impossible
for a stranger to find it, even in the daytime. Besides, you
said that <i>padre</i> Gayferos bade <i>all</i> the men join in the
carousal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did; and when it began all were present who were at
home, or at least so I was told in answer to my questions.
But that man whom we threw over the cliff? Who was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one of the regular members, but a sort of spy who
lives at the foot of the mountain. He came with news, I presume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, if you think best, let us hasten to the stable,
for the further we are away from this den by daybreak, the
safer I will feel about my neck. For my part, I have seen
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
quite enough for one night, although they do not stint
one in wine, and it was first-class, too,&rdquo; said Tadeo, as he closely
followed his companion, who now turned up a narrow defile,
the bottom of which was thickly strewn with coarse
gravel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a little of that same wine would not be amiss now.
But silence; we are nearly there,&rdquo; cautioned Canelo.</p>
<p>After making several abrupt turns, the two men paused in
front of a dense thicket, and Canelo uttered a low, peculiar
whistle, then repeated it twice, at short intervals. There was
no answer, and again he sounded the signal, but with the
same result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as I thought. There is no one here. Come; in five
minutes we will be clear of the mountain,&rdquo; cried Canelo, joyously,
and closely followed by Tadeo Campos, pushed through
the yielding screen of bushes, and after a few steps they entered
a spacious chamber, excavated from the earth.</p>
<p>Numerous large, lustrous eyes, in pairs, were turned toward
them, and when Canelo lighted the lamp that he had brought
with him from the cell, the glow showed them the sleek forms
of a large number of horses, standing in rude stalls, with their
accouterments ranged along the other side of the &ldquo;stable.&rdquo; A
few moments sufficed to saddle and bridle the two animals they
had selected, and then once more extinguishing the light, they
led their steeds out along the way they had entered, and in a
few minutes were clear of the hill and speeding along the
valley.</p>
<p>After riding some miles in silence, they drew in their horses
to a walk to breath them, and Canelo broke the silence by saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have not told me yet how it was you learned I
was a prisoner, and where they had confined me. How was
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in the first place, I overheard a conversation between
master Felipe, or rather he who passes as such, and a precious
scoundrel who called himself Don Lopez Romulo&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barajo; he goes by both names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And I then learned that the young man was an impostor,
and that you were yet alive. He did not then hint that
you were a prisoner; that I learned afterward. Well, this
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
Romulo or Barajo gave Don Felipe an address at Guanajuato,
where he was to call and pay him a lot of money to keep the
secret he had got hold of. I heard the address and resolved
to be at the meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the night came, I was hanging round the <i>venta</i>,
which was in a low part of the city just at the outside edge.
I waited until Don Romulo came out, jingling his pocketfull
of golden ounces, and after following him until he came to a
dark alley, I gave him a few inches of cold steel, and dragged
him into the alley, out of the way, and where I would not be
interrupted by any person passing by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not intended to kill him at once, but only disable
him, and then frighten him into telling where I could find you,
and any thing else that might be of service. He was badly
hurt, and it was not hard to frighten him into doing as I wished,
for the beggar vowed that he was not fit to die, and I did not
spare my threats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow he mistook me for one Ventura&mdash;Tomas Ventura&mdash;who
had once belonged to his band, and told me all that I
wanted to know. That you were kept a prisoner by him and
a priest, who had forced you to write the letter given to Felipe,
and make him believe that you was dying; and the place
where I would find the band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw that the poor devil would not live until morning,
and as he would have no use for the gold at the place he was
booked for, I transferred it to my own pocket, and left him
where he lay. Then I resolved to act upon what I had learned,
and try to rescue you, that the whole truth of the matter might
be arrived at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I passed myself off as Garote Ventura, seeking for my
dear brother Tomas, and as you know, gained my object after
some little trouble. And now, is this boy, the <i>real</i> Felipe Canelo,
alive, or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that he is dead,&rdquo; slowly answered Canelo. &ldquo;Yes,
he must be. He said he killed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look you, Senor Don Augustin Canelo,&rdquo; hotly replied
Campos. &ldquo;I am a quick-tempered man, as you know well,
and when I make up my mind to a thing, I generally do it.
Now you may be perfectly honest in what you say, but I don&rsquo;t
believe that you are. I have not told you all I heard from
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
this Lopez Romulo, and it is a clue that I can follow up, if
you do not satisfy me. It may be hard and require time, but
it can be done, if needs be. And if you play me false, by
the Virgin of Atocha, you will find the hand that set your body
free will not hesitate long about doing your soul the same service.
Do you understand me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. But there is no need of such heat. I told you I
was changed, and moreover, I have sworn upon the holy cross
to reveal the truth. What I may have to say I will keep until
it can be told to Senora Canelo herself,&rdquo; proudly answered
Don Augustin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! now I know you again. I will trust you,&rdquo; exclaimed
Tadeo Campos, as he set his horse once more into a
gallop.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br />EXPLANATIONS.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Thank the Virgin, we are nearly at the spring where we
can get a good drink of cold water. I am nearly famished
with thirst!&rdquo; exclaimed Tadeo Campos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this cursed road, added to the sun&rsquo;s heat, is intolerable.
See, the horses know it as well as we do, although I doubt
whether either of them were ever within fifty leagues of the
place,&rdquo; returned Augustin Canelo, as their jaded beasts increased
their pace of their own accord, with loud whickers of delight.</p>
<p>In the course of a few minutes the little grove was sighted,
and as the horses broke into a gallop, Tadeo, who was looking
intently toward their intended resting-place, uttered an exclamation
of vexation, and pulled up his horse, almost throwing
him upon his haunches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maldito! see, a fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough, some one is before us. But there can be no
danger. Let&rsquo;s advance. We must have water, and will, if I
have to fight for it!&rdquo; impatiently exclaimed Canelo, clapping
spurs to his horse&rsquo;s side, and charging ahead, closely followed
by Tadeo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Then they heard a report, succeeded in a few moments by
another, and again they halted. By this time they were close
enough to the spring to note the struggle going on between
two men, and then, as they fell to the ground, another puff of
smoke came, followed by a report, and the uppermost combatant
fell backward with a wild yell.</p>
<p>After waiting for a few minutes, and seeing nothing to occasion
further alarm, the two travelers approached the spring,
with arms in readiness, and sheltered behind their horses&rsquo; bodies.</p>
<p>There was no need of this caution, however, as they soon
found, and as but one of the three men showed any signs of
life, they at once set about restoring him. The first words that
Marcos Sayosa spoke when he once more opened his eyes, were
of Tomas Ventura; then noting the old man lying apparently
dead, the young miner rushed to his side, not heeding the astonishment
that was pictured upon the face of the two travelers.</p>
<p>On examination, they found that although very badly
wounded, Ventura was still alive, and set about restoring him.
For a long time all efforts were futile, but then the old man
opened his eyes, and when they rested upon Augustin Canelo,
he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy Virgin, it is he!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you indeed Tomas Ventura?&rdquo; eagerly asked
Canelo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, but I shan&rsquo;t tell you; you would kill him!
Yes, you would kill the boy, so you could get his wealth.
Ah-ha, I know you&mdash;I know you well. You wanted me to
murder the babe, but I fooled you; ha! ha! ha! yes, I deceived
you!&rdquo; screamed Tomas Ventura, wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he lives&mdash;you did not kill him? The child, I
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I did&mdash;I did kill him! Marcos, Marcos, come
here, or he will murder you because you stand between him
and wealth. Come, let us go to Senora Canelo, your mother,
Marcos; she will protect you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace, <i>tio</i>, no one will harm you now. These gentlemen
are friends. They saved our lives, don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;
said the youth, soothingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I tell you, no! He is your deadly enemy, that man
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
is. He is your uncle, and hired me to kill you, but I deceived
him, and now you will be rich&mdash;rich, and so will Carlita!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not altogether raving, senor,&rdquo; said Canelo, to
Marcos, as the latter glanced at him. &ldquo;But we can not explain
now. When we get to the <i>hacienda</i>, I will do so. Do
you think he could be borne in a litter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I <i>must</i> bear it! I must see the Senora Canelo
before I die, to tell her all I know,&rdquo; cried Ventura, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Augustin, what does this mean?&rdquo; asked Tadeo
Campos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear. It is true what he says. I did hire him to
dispatch Felipe Canelo, and if he speaks true, then this man
must be the real heir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The features are the same as his father&rsquo;s. Holy Mother,
if it should be true!&rdquo; murmured Campos, placing a hand
upon the shoulder of the astonished youth, and keenly scrutinizing
every feature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Felipe Canelo&mdash;what do you mean? Who am I?&rdquo; he
faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall soon see. But come. We must fix a litter between
two horses, and convey Ventura to the <i>hacienda</i>. There
is no time to lose,&rdquo; returned Canelo.</p>
<p>The litter was soon formed, and the wounded man placed
in it. Before they started, the body of Sylva Cohecho was
examined, but nothing of any importance discovered. Canelo
recognized him as one of the Jarochos who had belonged to
his band. He was left where he had fallen, to feed the <i>zopilate</i>
or <i>coyote</i>, a fitting end for the brutal traitor and murderer.</p>
<p>As they rounded the pile of granite, the concealed horse
that had belonged to Cohecho was discovered by his whickering,
and then the party were again remounted, and able to
travel at a tolerable rate without inconvenience. It was some
time after dark when they reached the <i>hacienda</i>, and while the
wounded man was being cared for, Tadeo Campos proceeded
to break the news to Senora Canelo.</p>
<p>He found the three sitting together, and, as Felipe had confessed
his fault to the elder lady also, his task was far less
difficult than he had anticipated. This he learned before he
told his story, and, thus set right, he narrated what he had
overheard, and the resolution he had come to, of searching
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
out the uncle, Augustin Canelo, and how he had accomplished
it; not, however, without many interruptions from his hearers.
He dared not tell all at once, but hinted that it was barely
possible the missing son might be found yet. Indeed, that
he was almost certain of his being yet alive and well.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Augustin Canelo had been closely questioning
Tomas Ventura, who was now perfectly sensible, and
was finally convinced that the youth we have known as Marcos
Sayosa was none other than the long-mourned-for Felipe
Canelo.</p>
<p>The astonishment of the latter, who heard it all, may be
better imagined than described, when he found that he was
the brother of the beautiful Luisa who had so deeply interested
him, and that the handsome, stately lady was his mother.</p>
<p>On the next day the entire party collected, and all matters
were fully cleared up, although it was a painful meeting between
the injured mother and the murderer of her husband.
No further doubt remained as to the identity of Marcos, or
Felipe, as we must now call him, and he was warmly, almost
wildly, welcomed by his mother and sister.</p>
<p>And the one who had believed himself the stolen son was
not the least happy among them, although his birth and parentage
were once more shrouded in mystery. All Canelo
could tell him was that he had been taken by a detachment
under Lopez Romulo, or Barajo, in an attack in which all but
he had been slain by the Jarochos. For what he was spared,
could not now be told.</p>
<p>Canelo had been threatened with death with the demands
of the priest and Romulo, and it was then that the letter was
written, and the youth deceived as to his parentage. After
his departure, Canelo had been confined in the cell with the
knowledge of only Andrez beside the two confederates; it
being given out that he had died, and was buried, at his own
request, by the priest and Romulo.</p>
<p>The youth once more took his name of Barana, but, to
prevent confusion, changed Felipe into Florencio, and some
two months after the discovery of the real heir, there was a
double wedding, in which Felipe and Carlita, Florencio and
Luisa, played the leading parts, and it is on record that
neither of the quartette ever had cause to regret the act.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Tomas Ventura recovered from his wound, and lived to
play with the children of <i>his</i> children, as he called Felipe and
Carlita, dying at a &ldquo;green old age,&rdquo; outliving Tadeo Campos,
who, however, taught Felipe junior how to ride and swim.</p>
<p>Augustin Canelo entered a monastery, but did not live long
after renouncing the world, his constitution being undermined
by the tortures he had endured at the hands of the fiendish
<i>padre</i> Gayferos.</p>
<p>Felipe made good use of his mining experience by discovering
a rich silver lode upon his own land, and was very
successful in working it.</p>
<p>Lucas Planillas was not forgotten by Felipe, who made
him his head <i>mandorne</i> upon his silver mine, and the majority
of his comrades who had borne the &ldquo;Scarlet Shoulder&rdquo; knots
were employed by him as workmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so we leave them, in peace and happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
